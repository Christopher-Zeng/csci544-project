"No, I am really not. Philosophy - from the Greek ""philos' meaning love and ""sophos"" meaning ""Wisdom"", the love of wisdom - is literally the study of how to think straight.

If you haven't learned philosophy, you will never be able to form a logical thought. No, what people think they are doing isn't logic. Logic is a set of rules. To think logically you have to know those rules, and apply those rules (much like algebra is a set of rules you have to know and apply to get the right answer).

To think you can be logical without studying philosophy is like claiming you can do algebra without learning to count first. 

Here's how it works:
Philosophers figure out how to understand things.
Scientists use those techniques to understand a particular thing.
Engineers use that understanding to solve practical problems.

Unfortunately - because true logic is so often counter-intuitive, those not schooled in it tend to think actual logical arguments are ""stupid"" because their intuition says so.","No, I am really not.

She did very well, so, instead, you are saying, in essence, ""Clinton did badly because she did so well. She had no business being so well prepared.  She had no business being so poised.""  

You have really made it clear ""she's damned if she does (do well) and damned if she doesn't.

Your calculations are off and your modification of a 20-round magazine is a straw man argument.

Five-round magazines means five-round magazines. Modifying a large-capacity magazine blocked at five rounds does not apply.
I do know what I am talking about; I have owned long guns and shotguns, I was a hunter, a reloader, and I have fired handguns and fully-automatic weapons. I am not anti-gun; I am pro-sanity.

I'll have you know, NP5491, that I chose those words very, very carefully. 

I watched, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that Trump is an idiot.

Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.

One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not).","""loose talk""????

"C'mon, Andy--thought you knew better.  My disagreeing with a woman doesn't mean I've denigrated or discriminated against her.  If I do ridicule her argument it's because it was a stupid argument.

Example: I have argued against single-track mountain-bike trails in high-density bear habitat based on public safety and wildlife conservation concerns.  A fatuous female named Lucille Bluth responded by accusing me of not wanting people to RIDE BIKES and wanting HER to stay home and have babies!  Naturally, I gave such an imbecilic reply all the ridicule it deserved.

"- The nation lost 31,200 full-time jobs, and gained 34,300 part-time jobs during the month.
- All the job gains were self-employed and public sector. 
- Canada lost 50,500 jobs in the private sector.
- this reflects the departure of 45,500 people from the labor force. About half of those were youth, meaning many young people looking for work have stopped looking.

"One attack, by a British born citizen no less, and Doug call this ""New wave"". Let me quote another: 

“Terrorism will not defeat democracy,” Lindsay Hoyle MP, who is deputy speaker of the House of Commons, told the BBC.

Everything the politicians don't like is an attack on democracy. Every war they wage is to protect democracy. You know, the people is tired of this old standard chest-thumping political excuse. 

A few days before this attack, U.S. led coalition, meaning U.S.-UK, conducted a massive air strike on Syria ""Islamists"" stronghold. But it turned out to be just a residence, killing 30 women and children. You don't see one word of this in the 'coalition' controlled media. 

Exact same thing happened in Canada Parliament a few days after when Harper ordered CF-18s to join in Iraq-Syria war.

You keep bombing them, they keep hitting you back. It's the POLITICIANS in charge who conduct this war policy in the Middle East. It's the people who get the retaliation. Stupid.","One attack, by a <CSD> born citizen no less, and Doug call this ""New wave"". Let me quote another:

"Dildough-twinkle is half right. At this moment tRump cannot be impeached with a GOP congress. However, once the illicit exploits of the tRump Criminal Enterprise™ are brought to light, public sentiment will turn on him. When anti-tRump fever reaches critical mass, and his psychotic Breitbart-fed fanatics are no longer a threat to GOP members, they will turn on tRump like a rabid dog. Remember, tRump is not really a Republican, nor is he a Democrat - he's a Trumplicrat, i.e., he only cares about one thing - himself. The GOP secretly despise him but most are too cowardly to confront him. Bannon will likely disown him once tRump stops being the useful idiot that he is and when that happens, his days are surely numbered. Hell I doubt his own children actually like him. They may love him, but only because he provided half of their DNA and children generally love their parents no matter how scummy they may be. Get your popcorn ready. tRump is going down.

"Problem:  The deluded and corrupt fools leading the legislative majorities have a lock on power because they keep getting reelected by their loyal but clueless constituents, largely due to gerrymandered districts.  The rest of us can't vote them out of office if we're not in their districts.

 Solution:  Take the majority away from them.  How?  By voting out any of your own legislators that are in the majority.  Even though they might be reasonably good reps, if they're in the majority, they're part of the problem because they empower the likes of Chenault and his cronies.

"I love the rationalizations trying to say that the CPC fundraisers were different because the cost of entry was lower (eg: when Nigel Wright hosted a private fundraiser at his home for an Ontario PC candidate or when Dykstra hosted lobbyists in the private booth of the Skydome Owner, or Baird, or Raitt, or the multiple events starring Duffy and Harper).

So in other words, the Liberals are the high priced call girls while the CPC were the less expensive street walkers?     Is THAT the difference?

Face it - ""cash for access"" is a sensationalist way to describe fundraising when a politician attends their own fundraiser.     It's been going on for as long as politicians needed money and there is nothing inherently wrong with it.

"I just love the way right-wingers call everyone with whom they disagree ""liars."" Not into personal insults, and I have no more inside info than you do. What I do know is there is an investigation underway, and we'll see how it turns out.

Trump's attempts to obstruct, now that the investigation follows the money, appears suspicious. If he's innocent, seems he would support an investigation to clear his name, and he likely wouldn't inquire about pardons for his aides, his family, and himself.

Kushner's testimony was ridiculous. Trump's senior advisor didn't even know the name of the attending Russian ambassador? And he didn't know the subject of the meeting, when the subject line clearly indicated its purpose? Why didn't Kushner disclose his contacts on his security clearance forms - his assistant's fault?

After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…

"He is as dumb as a bag of hammers, sadly.  He has no understanding of incentives, no cares about security, no sense of budgetary restraint, no modesty and no powers of analysis, let alone introspection.

He might even confront these silly judges who have run amok with the charter of needs and whims.  And for having common sense, he will be painted as a wacky extremist!

"If Haycox believes people are stupid and will vote based on stupid lies (except for democrats of course) - wouldn't it be smart for a candidate to tell lies if that's what it took to win?? What if the process of elections today has little to do with governing or the real motivations of a candidate?? 

Haycox also thinks that because he can show Trump continually lied - Clinton was the proper choice to vote for. But anyone who reads Haycox knows that he would think Clinton was the proper choice if a super clean and terribly honest traditional republican had run against her. 

Haycox needs to face the fact that even though most of the country finds the current president likable enough and he will leave office with good marks - there is enough unrest in America over federal economic, regulatory, and social policy - to elect someone else besides Cliinton.

"Not really.

People are killing each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit.

Hitler did it. Mao did it. Stalin did it. Lincoln did it. Pol Pot did it. So did Ivan the Terrible. The native tribes of North America did it. The British did it all over the world. 

The ""trample on other"" instinct is very powerful in humans and transcends religious beliefs. That is how you have Christian whites in the southern USA slaughtering Christian blacks in the southern USA, and how you have castes in India of the same religion trampling upon one another, that is how you had the north and south in the American civil war having the same religion.

People kill each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit. That ""trample on other"" instinct is actually the core and key problem, not the matter of whether others worship trees or have darker skin.","Not really.
