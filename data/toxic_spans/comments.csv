I bet you derived a lot of satisfaction out of typing that and no doubt smiled upon completion, marveling at your own ability to yet again be a jerk to complete strangers on the internet.

Seriously though, this is the kind of criminal the murdered Sgt. Gooding in Seaside.  The liberals in Salem can try to goody two shoes these animals all they want.  Shorter sentences and probation are not the answer.  This idiot will end up killing someone if he doesn't get killed by the cops first."

I have had the distinct displeasure of having this man as my senator for more years than I care to count, and I hope Matt succeeds.  Courtney is totally out of touch with those in his district, and continues to pursue his braindead liberal policies as he is reelected time and again by the same braindead constituents.

248961,"Wow. You prove the point made in the letter.  Just how many wars would you like to start at once?  Like The Donald, anyone who does not agree with you must be naive or stupid.

(Brown was asking for a total of $60k).  All of which is to say, again, that Brown -- who raped women, who abused women -- needs to be called out in spades, which has happened."

So, Martin, are you telling us you invoked your grandfather as a virtue signal of your own working-class credibility, despite never having met him? How impossibly disrespectful of you. I'm glad your grandfather has passed; it spares him the heart-stabbing shame of an ungrateful, pedantic little snot of a grandson who would seek to ride his coveralls into righteousness. He deserves better than someone like you.

The simple line in Atlantic City-

I was deeply moved by that single, almost whispered line when I bought the album at the age of 22, in the year 2000. Did you know he recorded that record alone, on a 4-track? Do you even know what a 4-track is? He covered Suicide on that record, in 1982. 

Do you even know who Suicide is, you smarmy little creep?"
254780,Nice come-back to quite a stupid comment.
254837,creating additional taxes that removes money from the local economy and given to the highly inefficient government to spend.... NOW THAT'S A FOOLS ERRAND
254902,It would be nice to know whom I am addressing but the RG editorial board only hides behind unsigned editorials while mandating everyone else sign theirs. Had this educated wonder done their homework...The State of Alaska legalized marijuana in 1975 when their State Supreme Court ruled their citizens have the constitutional right to grow and consume marijuana. The federal government waging a war on drugs did nothing. Not even the Reagan administration went after the State of Alaska. Now that other states have done the same through the vote....this argument is ridiculous.
254965,Damn Christians!
255170,You all need to quit talking about shit that is irrelevant. What's relevant is that a beautiful young woman is gone. Say some prayers for her children that got left behind and her mother who is devastated. It doesn't matter what info the police released or didn't release. It's really none of anyone's business until it is determined what exactly happened. The register guard really needs to stop with the publicity shit as well and allow a mother to grieve for her daughter without constantly having that wound reopens. Have some respect .

257498,"Problem:  The deluded and corrupt fools leading the legislative majorities have a lock on power because they keep getting reelected by their loyal but clueless constituents, largely due to gerrymandered districts.  The rest of us can't vote them out of office if we're not in their districts.

 Solution:  Take the majority away from them.  How?  By voting out any of your own legislators that are in the majority.  Even though they might be reasonably good reps, if they're in the majority, they're part of the problem because they empower the likes of Chenault and his cronies.  If you don't like what this legislature is doing, you need to sacrifice your own reps to fix it."

257794,"year after year this criminal dysfunction continued, and knowing it was going on the county board, city council and RG editorial board covered it up and promoted LCFM through Orwellian fraud. As is the repeated pattern throughout this policy history, all whistleblowers are DOA at the RG. It finally became so vulgar not even the social swine at LCFM could handle the stench coming off their social pig sty, and the city council finally removed their director who took the fall for doing LCFM corrupt board of directors criminal dirty work, and the city council placed a community babysitter over them the county had called for 12 years earlier to assure this obnoxious criminal dysfunction did not continue like it did.

258667,"Senator, I'm jaded.  Too often ""We must invest in Alaska's future"" is analogous to one fool convincing other fools into believing they can get a pile of granite rocks to burn.  They gather the rocks,  pour gasoline (i.e. state money) onto the rocks, throw a match and BOOM - there comes a huge ball of fire, with plenty of heat and smoke. They immediately celebrate their collective genius and return to the house.  The next day they go outside and discover nothing but a pile of warm rocks. So what do the do?  They try again to get the granite rocks to burn and again they fail. 
 So then they decide that they chose the wrong type of rocks. So they gather shale rocks  which are a different color (yet  just as inert).  Proclaiming they have found the solution they pour even more gasoline (state money) onto this ""new"" pile of rocks and the cycle repeats itself with exactly the same results.
 Saddly,  until the gasoline (state money) runs out they never quit trying to get those rocks to burn."

The cheap black market crap is still coming up from Mexican nationals, and the good stuff from BC and Humbolt.  The I5 corridor is still just as busy, and they are still making a ton of money. Nothing has really changed except that the legal market has made it easy for anyone of legal age to buy it.

That is a significant drop of almost 2/3s.  Studies have shown the sex education is the biggest factor in this decline. Places which have limited or no sex ed have higher birth rates among teen mothers.

288007,"It's is probably more common than you realize having experience and still screwing up.  My ex was in the AF and his job was combat arms training and maintenance (CATM).  He was emptying out his gun one day, but got distracted.  He thought he had cleared his weapon and so he fired the gun pointing at the car.  The bullet ricocheted off the trunk and out the window in the direction of people standing outside.  One of his fellow CATM members once thought he had cleared his weapon and so pulled the trigger.  He was in his truck and I think he shot his radio.  You'd think an AF Cop would know how to drive, but one hit me on Elmendorf AFB causing $5k in damage.  Military can be very stupid too."

They are aging losers now, especially if getting high with their children is considered good in any way.  It's no wonder the city, state and country are in the sad state they are, with this kind of pathetic nonsense considered in a positive way.

For those who are allergic,  do not like taste or smell of booze pot works for them. Ban booze if you ban pot  and be done with it or shut up about something that's no body's business except smokers.

291615,By the way does the alcohol control board require people selling booze to get it tested? Is booze ever tested? Is there a big problem with people buying bad booze in retail stores? No to all of the above. Don't they realize the pot underground self regulates the quality of it's plants because they are proud of their product and would sell very little if it was no good which would be pointless since no one would want it.

295318,"Democrats can reliably win the Peoples' Republic of Juneau's downtown district, a couple or three districts in Anchorage, downtown, the U-Med, and East Anchorage, a district or two in Fairbanks, and a couple of rural districts.   It's been that way for thirty years.   Sometimes the Ds come up with a particularly attractive candidate that can win in some other districts and sometimes they put up candidates that sound more like conservatives than most Republicans do.   All the Democrat efforts in redistricting have been to try to dilute solidly Republican areas so they have some hope of coalitions.   Now their toy is false-flag Republicans backed by the Democrats for districts where a D is the kiss of death.   You lefties liked gerrymandering when Knowles led the reapportionment in '00.   Hypocrites!"

Dude, your dinners ARE your business.

Another example of this man made ecological disaster is at the south end of Umnak Island where feral cattle and sheep have disturbed an archaeological site that is considered the oldest in the Aleutians. I've been there and helped rebury remains that were exposed from the animal caused erosion. To see literally hundreds of remains, exposed hearths and middens was deeply disturbing.

These animals have no value other than to a bored crabber and should be removed. They are no better than rats."

Nobody in their right mind would buy one of the ""houses"" there so the real estate market is a bust. Nobody is going to put any money into a business so again, what does Kivalina contribute to the state? The best thing that could happen would be for the Feds to condemn the village, demolish it and let the island return back to nature.

Bill Clinton, who was the best Republican President since Eisenhower, did some dumb things in the name of deregulation that screwed up banking and helped create the bubble...but so did lines of credit tied to your house and lower taxes on the wealthy.  The lines of credit created another bubble, one that masked the lack of wages, as people spent their equity. You could buy a car by borrowing money on your home... a really stupid idea, and something Krugman warned about. So yes they are angry, yet if they think Trump gives a crap, they are wrong, again.

I made sure to leave my legally carried weapon - solely for self defense,  at home so as there not being any doubt about anything from anybody. after walking a mile into a gathering group, I did see the sense of responsibility people outside felt and wondered why the man inside running for president didn't feel that same responsibility to be a good citizen.  and then seeing the people going in..looking so normal..i thought , this country is so screwed...we truly don't know our collective ***  from a hole in the ground. it was watching the village idiot  leading the blind."

308967,"You should always vote for who you like and who you think would do as you do. Trump wants to rebuild the economy and cutoff wasteful international tariffs that prevent American businesses from getting a foothold in the economy, as well as establish borders which all countries older than 100 years should have. Hillary wants to continue conflict in the middle east where thousands needlessly die and have their homes burnt to the ground by USA and it's partners, and tell you to shut up when she gets people killed or gets caught with her hand in the cookie jar. Not saying Trump wouldn't go to war but his priorities have middle east conflict on the backburner.

310286,"I have seen the estimates as high as $2 billion. Funny, though, how the press never estimates their own earnings based on their coverage of Trump, which would certainly be more than $2 billion. So it is not that they cover Trump because they like him, but because he generates revenue for them, and lots of it. Trump knows how the system works and uses it strategically to his advantage, far better than anyone ever has, yet some still think he is somehow stupid."

What other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?  

And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.  

No.  Tom, the wars are not over, just being conducted with different weapons and fewer deaths---at least of our people.

You'd think we could do better. The pivotal factor likely will be who they select for VP. If I were Clinton I'd select Sanders.

While I'm not in the VFW as is Hecker, even as a peacetime Cold War Vet I hate to see con artists rip off vets. Hecker's  concern with Trump is well founded, for while he preaches respect for vets his own history here is shady.

During the Viet Nam war, young men who were draftable faced tough choices.  Many went and ended up in that brutal war; others strongly opposed the war and refused to go.  I  respect and  honor both those decent American groups.  
But a third faction   ""patriotically"" supported that endless  war but found ways to keep their own precious selves safe by endless deferments and questionable  methods.  One of those  jerks, a military school graduate,  is running for president.  And he even ridiculed a true Viet Nam hero."

351677,"Exactly. When I left the GOP primary here in Fairbanks on March 1, I saw a LOT of people standing in that long line who I know usually vote Democrat. Why?

I've asked a few of them since and they all said they wanted to assure that Hillary would have an easy win.

But I think Trump may surprise them. I think the mood of this country's voters are such that they will reject an establishment insider Wall Street syphocant like Hillary. People want change and not the change that results in the middle class footing the bill for the indolent and the elite. People may still vote for Trump, but they don't need to. There's a third choice -- reject the two major parties that keep giving us idiots to run the country. I don't love Gary Johnson. The Libertarians could have chosen better. But he will do less harm to the country than either of the two idiots we know so well. And the change libertarianism would bring would perhaps save the country from economic and socio-political ruin."

FBI Director James B. Comey said there was evidence to suggest a disregard of standing security protocols, but said the FBI findings determined that ‚Äúno reasonable prosecutor‚Äù would likely bring criminal charges. 

Comey was George W. Bush's Deputy Attorney General--not a leftie. But cue the conspiracy nuts anyhow... ""This is so corrupt!""

The location that they lived within has NOTHING to do within the action taken.

There are bad circumstances within upper hillside, there are bad circumstances within Turnagain, there are bad circumstances  within midtown, Government Hill, Mountain View, Fairview, etc.

This is NOT a case of location, but a case of one individual killing another, and THAT, my friend, can occur within ANY location within this city, should said individual decide to take another life, and attempt to take their own.

Moronic and violent behavior does NOT lend itself unto a specific neighborhood."

All this over his own ambitions....I guess the real losers are the people of Kaneohe, Kailua, Lanikai, and Wainamanalo.

I think there are many voters of all strips who want to belong, have a sense of community, that they understand.  Younger voters are much more likely to appreciate the energy and vitality of change.  They like Sanders because he has energy, great for and gray-haired white guy.  We all believe in the balance between the conservative, values of the past but again being anti-youth, anti-gay, anti climate change in really just putting one's head in the sand.

1st.....The AR15 has been on sale in the US since 1965....The issue is PEOPLE not the method of their attack...The Boston bombers used fireworks to kill, Oklahoma city bomber used fertilizer, and on 9/11 they used airplanes...There are currently THOUSANDS of laws on the oohs pertaining to guns and we don't enforce most of them.. This foolish notion that the bad guys who currently break todays laws will all of a sudden start abiding by the next set passed.

Here is an idea.Lets start going after gangs and inner city thugs. They contribute the most to our gun violence issue but are never discussed. Then lets start enforcing the laws. Arrest and punish those caught with illegal guns or who break the law with guns. I spend a lot of time and money to do it legally...Most cops don't want bans on rifles as they are used in less than 4% of gun crimes, they want bad guys locked up, not out"

Yet day after day in this new letter it‚Äôs a continuous Trump bash. I know I‚Äôm pointing out the obvious right? or am I because you Hillary supporters think all is well with your candidate don‚Äôt you?

BECAUSE cops have guns, citizens need to be armed. BECAUSE the military has guns, citizens need to be armed.

Why would you be so stupid as to allow these jackbooted thugs to be armed while disarming yourself? Do you not realize that they can get away with anything if the people are not armed?

And, yes, I am paraphrasing about a dozen Founders who are now rolling in their graves at your foolishness.

If the government is armed, the people must be armed or we will very soon find ourselves living in utter tyranny. The fact that cops and soldiers think they can shoot regular people with impunity proves that we cannot trust them to be armed while we are disarmed."

Sad misuse of power by the chief that should have been prevent.  #2. Read her Statement under Oath to the Ethics Commission.  At page 25 lines 20-21 and I quote "" I feel, you know, stupid, but I wasn't there when the mailbox thing came about"".  Her words, her command, her failure.  In her absence a replacement, anybody other than the Chief would work for me, should have made the call.

Into the 50s progressive was a synonym for communist, and a ""progressive person"" was a trusted fellow traveler but in a position where s/he couldn't be an open, card-carrying member of the Party.  Liberal became the substitute for use in polite company during the Cold War years until failed liberal policies made liberal a pejorative as well.   The government schools had done a good enough job of revising and air-brushing history that by the 90s it was felt safe to go back to the term progressive.

Mr. Trump's vanity is absurd when looking at people like Gates, Buffet, Hemingway, or the accomplishment of women who have overcome bias to excel in education, the arts, motherhood and industry.   I'll celebrate the 95 year old matriarch still guiding her grandchildren to a good life, thank you.    How about the pastor or counselor who faces great emotional pain every single day and does so in private?   

Trump expects worship, he'll get none from me.

It's my opinion.  I don't like the man and it has little to do with his wealth.   I've met braggers and bullies my whole life, as you the reader have.   The fact that Trump wears a thousand dollar suit doesn't hide his sociopathic behavior.

The Powers That Be learned their lesson then, and an increasingly consolidated media has been putting those lessons into effect with establishment-oriented messages and astro-turf movements ever since.

Unfortunately, if he finally realizes that--like Donald Trump--the more he keeps talking, the more foolish he looks, and that he still has a chance to fade away now with at least shread of dignity remaining, he will also never have to really answer the main questions I have asked him to answer several times now--which tells me he is either incompetent to answer them, or knows he cannot answer them honestly without being cut off financially by his pimp.  

We can also only hope that ""Richard Johnson 693"" does not literally mean there are really 692 other equally officious RJ's online--unless he is actually a computerized ""bot"" or a corporate ""person"" instead of an actual real live and merely mortal pseudo-human being:)--con't."

You contradicted your comment in my opinion and said exactly what I am saying. The programs, intervention abd treatment is lacking. Even a basic level could have been established by now. I can say with confidence that many doctors and staff have attended conferences and symposiums on addiction. That costs lots of money. Save that money and put it directly where it needs to go. Clearly law enforcement is never going to address high end dealing. People don't realize this isn't some big kingpin crime ring. The way this work in Alaska and the bush is little by little.

436862,"""who do you think should do the killing?""

Anyone and everyone. This is a community problem, so everyone who wants to be part of the solution should be allowed to help. As I said above: remove all protections on free ranging cats, and allow people to help. People who allow their pets to roam outside are part of the problem, because their pets are part of the problem. It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. Kill them."

Even our hope that she does her best, is just that ""hope"", not a demand.

You can test my theory for yourself.  Visit Alaska.

BTW: I use the term ""ignorance"" in its classical sense...absence of knowledge.  I consider stupidity to be the persistent refusal to acquire knowledge and, instead, maintain views and opinions based on ignornace.

Just divert the river to the center of the 1/2 mile dry river bed would solve this!! OH THE FISH??? Well all greenys should not live in homes or drive cars if that's how they feel!"

447958,"I wouldn't urinate on Trump if he were on fire, and most likely he does harbor the passive racism of our culture. But as far as this campaign goes, what he said in regard to illegal aliens is spot-on, and echoed by every Mexican national and legal immigrant I know (which are many). They'll flat tell you the ones hopping the border are the scum of Latin society, and they're glad to see them go.

His ideas on ""banning"" Muslims are ridiculous and unConstitutional, but, Islam is an ideology, not a race. It's a repugnant ideology at odds with our way of life and human rights in general, but people have a right to their superstitions in this country. We'll just have to do with those practicing it as prescribed by the founder on a case-by-case basis."

Israel has had nuclear weapons likely since the 1950's, and despite all the fighting that's gone on between Israel and it's neighbors since then, Israel hasn't used them, to their credit.

Regarding Hillary and Donald, both reprehensible people, both liars, both at least in part psychopathic personalities, though their respective administrations would have differing impacts on our nation. In the broader picture both parties at the higher power levels are thoroughly broken and corrupted (which is why Trump appeals to many, because of what he isn't - an entrenched, professional politician, beholden to PAC money), but are people looking closely enough at what he is? Hillary on the other hand is just a nightmare, and stands for the worst of what a corrupted system has to offer."

Trump's new Deputy Campaign Manager, Citizens United President David Bossie, ""has devoted his career ever since to trying to tear down Hillary Clinton""

There is no disguising the truth: Bossie will be assisting Kellyanne Conway as an anti-Clinton character assassin, and Hillary for America Chair John Podesta released the following statement:

‚ÄúDavid Bossie is so craven and maniacal that in the heyday of the overreaching, Gingrich-era Congress, the top Whitewater conspiracy theorist in the House had to fire him for doctoring evidence. He has devoted his career ever since to trying to tear down Hillary Clinton

She reeked of alcohol herself which means, that yes, he was drinking, she probably gave him the alcohol and then they decided to wait several hours for the driver's blood alcohol to go down. He only came forward because there were multiple witnesses!! I am sick. This is some of the most vile behavior I have read, they stopped the car, and he got out and pulled the victim from his windshield and threw him on the ground. They both need to be charged with the MAXIMUM punishment possible. Mother & son deserve to be shot."

Let's clear the fog right now. When you were making the city ""financially stable"" you laid off an entire background recruiting section because they wouldn't let you lay off the 30 officers you planned to eliminate because of push-back. You only held academies when you were campaigning, which you HAD to because officers were retiring early because of your awful administrative oversight of public safety. You forced the Gang Task Force to be eliminated and put a moratorium on related training, dropping SWAT is 1/2 of the staff it used to be. Burglary became a Patrol Officer job, not for Detectitives - eg: No Followup. 

APD was purposely understaffed during your tenure - 408 officers dropped to 320. And you have the balls to take credit for our current uptick in employment. I'm so glad you're gone. I wish it had happened four years earlier. Now please go completely away."

The only reason the dividend will go broke is if the economy crashes or if the state of Alaska keep siphoning off the available money that the Dept. of Revenue Treasury Division uses for reinvestment into the fund to fuel a budget that THEY have been elected to get a handle on. Walker's logic that because the government screwed the pooch and they have to cut back so should we. That's a bunch of BS as they have had years to get the bloated budget under control and they've just kept deferring it to the next year. Now they're faced with a ""crisis"" and we're expected to sacrifice because THEY couldn't do the job they were elected to do! Walker is an idiot for ""biting"" the hand that feeds him and he probably feels proud that he made the decision to make us pay for his fellow lawmakers indecision which is why he'll just be another one term wonder."

Shame on you people for trying to sentence an entire breed of dog to death which isn't even the dog's fault it's almost always certainly the owners fault.

Radiation poisoning is not communicable especially when it's totally mythical. The folks in Point Hope just kill things and they don't care whether it's legal or not. If it moves, kill it. If it flies it dies.

 This is very similar to the villagers in Kipnuk who destroyed the entire Kilbuck caribou herd back in the 80s and then killed every single caribou that was transplanted at great cost to Alaska taxpayers, into the area to rebuild the herd. When the troopers tried to arrest one of the villagers for killing caribou out of season and taking more than the limit of caribou, the entire village rallied around the perp and tried to arrest the trooper under village sovereignty. Ignorant, irresponsible fools."

Nevermind that the air we breathe at sea level is made up mostly of nitrogen.  She's a scientific moron.  That's why she's controversial.  She's an idiot and a liar.

Yet the RG editors allow this sort of rot. Hillary Clinton is your compulsive liar, who has broken numerous federal statutes. Removing classified material is a felony, and that's for starters. Mrs. Clinton has said ""She doesn't remember,"" and gets to skate because of a corrupt federal government. Hillary Clinton also lied to the families of those who were killed in Benghazi, including a US Ambassador. Clinton and the administration knew it was an organized Al-Qaeda attack (on September 11, 2012! Imagine that!) but claimed to America and the families some obscure YouTube video triggered angry Muslims. The Middle East is aflame today because of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, threatening the security of the US and our allies.  Yet all crybaby leftists can do is blubber what a big meanie Donald Trump is."
495661,"This is from a second semester course at Trump University: Trump Maxim XV:  Never accept blame for your failures.  Always be prepared to blame others for your shortcomings.  As a corollary, never apologize for any statement or action.  Remember: It is never your fault.

However, as a critique, if Trump had actually prevailed during the debate, he would be boasting to no end, so the need to invoke the above Maxim, indicates that he knows he made an ass and a fool of himself."
495827,"con. We will likely never agree on this one.  

 I do find it a bit amusing that you manage to criticize Ms Clinton because she did well in the debate. She was well informed, articulate, poised and very statespersonlike.  Yet, you twist that to be detrimental.  Had she, like Trump, been unprepared, nervous, rude, and ill-at-ease for the entire debate, you would have criticized that.  She did very well, so, instead, you are saying, in essence, ""Clinton did badly because she did so well. She had no business being so well prepared.  She had no business being so poised.""  

You have really made it clear ""she's damned if she does (do well) and damned if she doesn't.

The only acceptable option is a FAIR TAX, based on a flat percentage of income, same rate for all, no exemptions, no exceptions. NO WAY should success be penalized and sloth or incompetence rewarded. America is about equal opportunity, not equal outcome. If you chose no education and a crap paying job (like ""community organizer"" for example) you have no one but yourself to blame and your envy of and anger at others success is pathetic.

At 6-foot-2, the height that he has long given profile writers, ... [b]y government guidelines, Trump is obese. In a weasel move to avoid that classification, Trump now says he is 6-foot-3, which makes him merely overweight. How he grew an inch, at the age of 70, is a story that has escaped his hagiographers at Fox.

Trump‚Äôs ducktail hairdo, colored in a hue unknown to nature, is a complicated comb-over inspired by Dr. Seuss.

Trump‚Äôs hands are smaller than 85 percent of American men. No surprise he lies about that.

Sorry, guys and girls, someone with a brain and knowledge needs to lead our nation, not a television blowhard who doesn't know where Aleppo is, or thinks Miss Universe is a ""fat pig"".

No, I can't believe a man would say those things. A real man doesn't brag about sexually assaulting women. That's something a scumbag does."

514337,"No, Chugiak. Until you can prove that you have magically developed ESP, you only look stupid when you keep bleating that you know that 'every' man lacks the ability to practice integrity and respect. It's really just the overgrown adolescents you surround yourself with. When (and if) you ever mature out of adolescence, you may gain the capacity to understand why many other men, with wives they love, mothers they admire, and daughters they would die for, are sickened by this rich entitled sexist asshat."
514420,Who really gives a damn!!! I'm sure Obama one said Michelle's pants make her ass look hughe!!!!!
514738,465 million is chump change to Mylan.  Their profits are so ridiculous that it won't even make a dent for them to pay this penalty.  They are still more than eager to deprive hard working people of life saving drugs in order to keep those billions coming in.  How long are Americans going to put up with this blatant and unashamed profiteering?  Maybe when enough folks die because they get stung by a bee or eat shellfish and can't afford to carry their EpiPen for emergency life saving epinephrine.

515386,"The two-faced, hypocritical ranting of the democrats and the liberal main stream media is absolutely mind boggling to me! You say DJT does not deserve to be President based on these comments he made years ago but then you elected and re-elected Bill Clinton as President of this country.  As governor of Arkansas and as President he was a womanizer, sexual predator, accused rapist and sexual abuser of his employees and volunteers and your HRC enabled him every step of the way! Don't forget what he did with a cigar while in the Oval Office and be sure to check out comments he's made being posted as we speak. 
DJT is certainly not a great candidate but please stop criticizing him every step of the way while pumping up your ""salt of the earth"" (sarcasm) candidate!!!"
515429,"trump is finished. He's made a MOCKERY OF AMERICA !!!

trump has dragged America INTO THE GUTTER WHERE HE LIVES.

America DEMANDS BETTER THAN A PIG LIKE TRUMP."

515451,So here we are with gutter trash heading up both tickets.  Totally disgusting.  We would be better off choosing two candidates at random out of the phone book.
515533,Ok.. blinders off. Bill Clinton is not running for President and Donald Trump is a pig.
515537,"trump is a disgusting porcine misogynist and now EVERYONE in the world knows it.

trump is HORRIBLE FOR AMERICA.

 If not for his wealth and stature, at the time, the sorry attempt at humor in Trumps comments would have been received with a roll of the eyes or a shake of the head and then pretty much ignored. He would be treated as the dork of the group for his lack comedic creativity and tact but not much else. Crude and tactless, for sure. Uncommon; not so much."

515833,"Good grief! Bill had adulterous sexual relations in the oval office for gods sake! If that isnt pathetic for a sitting US president I dont know what is. The only thing more pathetic than that is the Iran giveaway deal, which was the towering pinnacle of absolute, unabated stupidity."

Pussycat, pussycat, I've got flowers
And lots of hours to spend time with you
So go and powder your cute little pussycat nose
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat nose

Pussycat, pussycat, you're so thrilling
And I'm so willing to care for you
So go and make up your big little pussycat eyes
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do
You and your pussycat eyes

Pussycat, pussycat, you're delicious
And if my wishes can all come true
I'll soon be kissing your sweet little pussycat lips
Pussycat, pussycat, I love you yes I do"
516168,"It's actually not slander. Public figures (Trump and Clinton) are actually fair game for such commentary. If Trump get's elected, he's promised to do what he can to change that. Just one of his many ridiculous promises which will not be fulfilled due to his impotence. But yeah ... saying Hillary killed people is the height of stupidity."

How is it that that fact seems to have eluded Republicans until JUST THIS WEEK??"
516445,I can't believe in a great country like this these are the best citizens we can find to represent our country to the free world. Both are childish and corrupt. I feel so sad for us. Trump is a conman. He has made and lost millions this way. That's all he knows. Hillary is a child. She will never truly take responsibility for anything. Trump is ultra right. Hillary is ultra left. We have no moderate. How can I make a choice with only these people. No 3rd party candidate has ever been elected to president to my knowledge. I saw an article somewhere that had 30 reasons Trump should not be president. Then it turned around and gave 30 reasons why Hillary should not be president. Trump's problems have been brought out and we all know every one of them. Hillary has a whole lot I had forgotten about. But both of them are not fit to be president according to the comparison. Only upset both parties have not done a reset and start over. Truthfully this is a Pandora box for both of them.
516455,Right. Which tabloid did you dig that up from? What a fkn moron
516496,"So it takes a admitted sex offender for Ohio  Dan to disown him?

Trump should register on the sex offender list. 

Oh and Ohio Dan, predators don't choose respect, they choose victims. Do ya get it now?"
516599,"Bill Clinton also: rapes women, penetrates women with cigars in the Oval office, hangs out with child rapists on their rapist islands, blatantly lies to the American people and perjurs himself before congress. 

But ya' know, Trump followed the tax law and said some rude things about Rosey O'Donnel, so I guess that's worse?"

516929,"Trump has been an anomaly at the best since I've watched his antics in the '80s.  Thirty years of stupid pet tricks that always had me wondering how anyone would even think about doing a real estate deal with him.  Turns out that was just part of the total dysfunctional package.  And Lisa has seen the same crass, insulting, low brow antics we have for the last year and a half.  The Groper Old Party has done itself in largely due to the silence of those like our three Horsemen.  Pathetic."
517292,Thank you Lisa and Dan. Trump is a bully.
517324,So you have no problem with Trumps behavior. I'd love to see how you react when someone introduces himself by grabbing your genitals.
517349,"Hilarious reading all of these comments from people who have never paid a tax to support our state government for their entire lives (unless you go back to 1980)!  These same people complain about the free thousand bucks we all received last week (thanks to oil) not being enough! ""Give me a thousand more bucks because I deserve it!""  What are we, a welfare state?  Socialists? ""No, we are an owner state.""  Whatever. 

Plain and simple, if you tax more of something, you will get less of it. Want less oil and fewer jobs? Tax oil more and see the results. We are already struggling because Alaska is such an expensive place to do business given our climate, lack of infrastructure, ENGOs, etc. Moriarty hits the nail on the head and reasonable people will appreciate her column. 

Meanwhile, these same people that complain about their money for nothing want to tax everyone but themselves in order to maintain our state services.  You can't fix stupid."

517977,"Trump is right--his Republican denouncers are self-righteous hypocrites.  They're pretending to moral sensitivity that they obviously lack. This of course includes the distinguished senators from our own dear state.

He is an amazingly narcissistic imbecile who possesses zero character, intelligence, talent, skill, or knowledge. It is depressing, disheartening,  disturbing, and horrifying that so much of the population does support him.   I don't think I will ever be able to look at another Trump supporter without laughing.

Personally, here's what I think she should have said last night: ""Anybody in a position of leadership in government is going to have both public and private positions. It is inevitable. Responsible leadership means having the ability to discern between personal opinions and public responsibilities in order to arrive at responsible decisions.

Is PJ Media the kind of trash you waste your time on?"

522236,"American voters opted to loath Bill Clinton's womanizing, but as far as we know he didn't rape any of his participants.  What the voters loathed even more was the Republicans in Congress hypocrisy:  Henry Hyde and his ""youthful indiscretions,"" at the ripe old age of 55, Newt Gingrich cheating on his cancer stricken wife while she laid in the hospital fighting for her life, and his second wife recently left him for the same reason.  And let's not forget former House speaker, Dennis Hastert who repeatedly raped a teenage boy and wound up funneling $1 million + to the now adult male.  Hastert wasn't prosecuted for his past raping behavior.  This guy was two steps away from the White House for gawd sakes.  I don't condone any elected officials infidelity behavior, man or woman. tRump has been exposed BEFORE he tries to set foot in the White House.  Can you imagine tRump trying to grab Princess Kate Middleton's genitals all because tRump thinks she's a beauty that he can't resist?"
522599,"So, the Donald saw a twofer - a business opportunity with pretty young women attached, and a pair of suckers to take to the cleaners.  Trump pulled it off - taking candy from a baby.  So, let's blame the feckless, ill-starred entrepreneurs, right?  The clay pots drifting downstream alongside the cast-iron Dutch oven, who is looking for a little additional flotation, right? Get close, and the clay pots are broken.  That is what happened.  This was minor entertainment for The Donald, New York City's biggest trash-sifter.  Who cares about the Little People, right?

If you vote for Trump, you're either a loser, or a Big Shot Player.  Which are you, folks?"

525378,"Mary55, what you and so many others on this board fail to realize is that this is not just about the words spoken by the man. What he said reflects an imbalance of power by which (some) males feel entitled to treat women like pretty playthings. This was an assertion of control over her appearance. It's the same reason that Trump's use of the word ""pussy"" is outrageous not because of the profanity but because he diminished and demeaned all women when he said it. With all due respect, you are flat out wrong: it does NOT go both ways."
525382,"Yeah, she should have shown some stones and just back handed the idiot for being a little punk like his mama would have done!"

She didn't NEED the airline to oust him. I gaurantee she could have put words in the air that would have made him stare at the floor the entire flight in shame.

We all know this is a FACT. This is how Democrats behave. They love being raging unapologetic hypocrites.

We have controlled Guantanamo since the Spanish American war I believe so it wasn't a big deal to open a torture camp there to avoid having to give the accused real trials in the US court system. The blind sheik who was behind the first Trade Tower bombing in 1994 or so was indicted, tried and convicted in US Federal court and is now serving time somewhere ""up the river"". Our system worked under Clinton but then the Bush administration decided to break with all tradition by using torture, rendition to torture centers and military tribunals to deal with anyone even suspected of wrongdoing. Trump is using and building on that illegal policy. President Obama tried to close the prison and has released many of the suspects who have been held without charges let alone trial for 15 years."

Keillor, ol boy, you are  better off sticking to your  PBS vaudeville shtick because as a political commentator, you are not quite so witty, a half wit at best.   As one who hails from a state that elects a blow hard pro wrestler as their governor and nasty little SNL unfunny ‚Äúcomedian‚Äù as their US senator, you are relegated to the world of comedy permanently.

Harper came under the same scrutiny that any Canadian leader faces.    He also had the same fawning press when he first took power.     He was just too inept to take advantage of it."
537499,"Right. It was Democrats who nominated the blithering idiot Sarah Palin for the Vice Presidency. Oh, wait, that was the Republicans, the same group that considers Ann Coulter and Michelle Bachmann voices worth listening to."
537536,And when Trump goes down in flames you will claim the election was stolen. Pathetic loser whining.
537624,"Calling Sarah Palin a blithering idiot is a simple statement of fact. Did you ever listen to that word salad in which she demonstrated that she is not a quitter by, well, quitting? 

My point is that people who consider Palin, Coulter and Bachmann serious political voices are not showing great intelligence in choosing who is to speak for them.

""Your arrogance notwithstanding"" is not exactly a model of civility, is it?"
537834,"Um, I think you've forgotten that Walker DID propose the different taxes in several different bills, and the legislative leaders said, ""No, put them together so we can discuss and vote on the whole picture.""

But the fear of being accused of starting it kept me from talking about it these past 65 years.  Who would believe me.  Women our age just didn't talk about it.  I knew of others violated in various degrees and they were silent to the public and family, only speaking out to a close friend.  Things change, sometimes for good.  But for people to say, why didn't you speak out sooner?  Fear, shock, self inflicted guilt.  If for no other reason, I will not vote for a bully!  To give someone credit for picking on weaker or smaller for no other reason than you can, is not right.  DT has used privilege for many obnoxious acts, ill-treatment of employees, sex, refusing to pay for work contracted.  These are a few of the acts that are not honorable, or honest.  This man does not represent me or my principles, or the truths we were taught growing up."

539621,You forgot to add that black people are WAY more likely to comit violentlent crimes than whites thus they have much higher interaction rates with police.  So if you look at it that way a (Harvard study did this year) if anything whites were shot at a higher rate than blacks.
539757,"Certainly. If you pick your panties out of your butt crack, you can generally think more clearly. Give it a try."
539787,"So, is it misogyny when Hillary Clinton called her husband's rape victims sluts, tramps and whores? Or when she threatened them to keep silent? Or when she accused a 12 year old rape victim of being a nymphomaniac and seeking out her rapist? Or just when Donald Trump says some nasty things about some nasty people?"
540045,"After last night's admission that he may not accept the results of the election, it seems rather obvious that Trump planned on losing all along - that his bid to run for the highest office in the land was nothing more than a reality-show ruse to launch Trump TV Network after the election with his new, built-in base of alt-right Breitbart readers to add fuel to the fire. He'll even keep Steve Bannon on to run the show, merely stamping the Trump name onto the new venture like he does all those buildings in New York in which he has no real financial interest at all. As with everything else about Donald Trump, it's all for show. There's no there there. He's become nothing more than a tacky franchise.

I have to wonder how his loyal band of followers must feel knowing that they've been played for fools and idiots. If they haven't yet figured it out they're more foolish than I realized - and that's saying something!"

I'm not saying Trump should be Pres, but this is hardly the worst thing about him."
541459,"Also no mention of the history of this ""voter fraud "" issue. The Republicans ever since Geo. Bush (and maybe before) have been pushing the idea of voter fraud in order to bring in Voter ID laws that in fact just discourage poorer voters (who tend to vote democrat) from voting. Harper also played with the idea of voter ID because of possible fraud. Trump is not the first idiot along these lines."

Most people in the EU do not want CETA - this is a fact, Canada please smell the coffee! That only the Wallonians had a government with the courage to represent the wishes of it's citizens says more about how bought most EU governments have become. 

CETA and other so-called 'free-trade' agreements want to un-democratize ordinary citizens and hand over power to corporations instead and the brave people in Belgium should be congratulated for not wanting to play this rotten game and selling out, like Sanders in the US has."

Those who already own us also own the major media which keeps voters distracted. ""Liberal media"" or ""conservative media"" is mostly corporate media. The economic elite owns our domestic police and uses them to quash protests such as Standing Rock...and then uses their media influence to not mention the large mass of indigenous protestors. The real crimes of our government involve the use of our military and Air Force to destroy mostly Brown-skinned nations in order to steal the resources for private benefit and destabilize regions near Russia...in order to eventually control everything. It's called ""disaster capitalism,"" neoconservatism and neoliberalism."

Obama has been the most bazaar and destructive president we have EVER had, his race baiting has divided Americans and set us back decades and the madness he has created in America would be carried on by Killary. Having more liberal justices will only contribute the decline of the America many of us grew up in and love.

Ron Wyden lives in New York with his family and stops by Oregon every few months to have a town hall or glad hand for money then he goes back to Washington and instantly forgets the wishes of his constituency and votes against their best interest over and over again. The only reason that we are still having to worry about the TPP passing and the only reason it was put on fast track after it was dead was Ron Wyden. Wyden kept alive the biggest sellout to American sovereignty to the corporate elite that has ever been proposed. He showed his true stripes ...he is owned by corporate America and is willing to sell out everybody else at the drop of a hat . Pathetic Ron Wyden's human garbage. And you guys keep electing him"

545136,"It has been my experience that people get some things right even though they sound a little goofy. I think supporting Trump is a bit like that. There are some things he says - just like Bernie says - that reflect how many folks feel about the politics of this country. 
So the answer to your question is - no. Electro shock is simply too expensive on an individual basis - and the outcome is in question as well - ha!!

But when we tell folks that we don't know from Adam - whose political support we seriously disagree with - that they are stupid, misguided, or in need of electro shock - particularly if we are masquerading as some arbiter or truth and rational thought -(which Haycox always sees himself as) - then we stop being agents of change and start being agents of war. 

To me Haycox is like Hannity - boys who bring matches to a flammable party. I think Trump is a nut job - but I still value my friendships with those who support him too much to call them stupid. That's my politics."

I cannot count the number of times I had seen committed within the context of drug dealing utilizing underage runners from the now nonexistent Inlet Inn back and forth to the Transit Center, the Covenant House kids taking part in illegal activities, not only within impunity, but with full support of their sponsors, individuals passed out all over the place, marked by traffic cones, etc.

So, assuming, argendo, that what the wing nuts say about Clinton is true; she's a murderess, a consummate liar, has escaped prosecution for multiple crimes we should praise her for doing a public service by demonstrating how easy it is to get away with murder, corrupting the government and in and on.  Wow! Hillary Clinton is a hero, digging out corruption everywhere--just like Trump--by committing crimes and getting away with it.  Brilliant! 

And what ""service"" to our country has Trump's numerous assaults on women and children been? Are our laws against sexual predation by the ultra rich elite too weak? That must be it! Thank GOD Trump came along to ""prove"" that by his criminal actions, which he continues to indulge. 

Idiot."
568281,"your typical of liberal dumb, no loser we didnt know the deficit would be pushing 30 bil a year,, what happened to deficits bad when harper had them? oh right, liberal spending good, what hypocrites.."
568412,"these fools think government spending is better than private, what stupidity and arrogance they live in as they do real damage to canada"
568446,"No, the penis requirement is NOT for God's sake!"
568759,"my god you idiot libs are clueless thinking only Government owning and building is what works best,, we already pay far enough in taxes for such gov projects, we have overspending that is the problem, not revenue, get the house in order first befoer you beg to take more of my money"
568763,we want trade and private growth not more government idiot
568942,"It's only a ""scandal"" because civil beat says it was. How ya like that, civil beat? He was found not guilty! Your rush to judgement and UNETHICAL ""news reporting"" about Mr. Kenoi and other topics and events is despicable. DESPICABLE."
568974,The comment should then be directed at what Trump said rather than poking fun at a any perceived physical abnormality. Otherwise the whole debate can degenerate even further than it has. Trump is a jerk but let's try rise above his debase comments or we become similar to him. Just saying!
569017,"Maybe just surprised and dumb? Because they did endorse him, just like they did four years ago. Remember the vocal minority who vowed to resign from the sierra club, never donate again, etc etc. Looks like they SC got along fine without those cayetano supporters, and continue to look at the big picture, which in this case is Djou would be a disaster."
569050,"Yes, but isn't it ironic how the Red farm states have embraced this socialistic BIG government program?

Even Joe Miller took farm subsidies in Kansas.

Hypocrites!"
569059,The great Canadian crap-shoot.  Brought to you by the Village Idiot.

569708,In reality Wyatt is an idiot.
569841,"They are equally sick of the ugly ""pants suit"" liar!"
570059,"‚ÄúHandguns are very intimate firearms.‚Äù

Very true. The most intimate really, seeing as how large guns are really just compensatory palliatives for their owners‚Äô pelvic shortcomings. (Note to Trump voters: All that fancy language means making a big gun go boom helps you forget about your small penis.)

This post is intended as humor."
570216,"Damn..two weeks ago Comey was an upstanding, trustworthy guy.  Now that he is pulling his head out of his ass and doing his job, he is a partisan hack.  Someone should start writing his obituary, because they're going to find him suicided here pretty soon methinks."
570290,"As much as I'd like to see these fools removed from any further temptations to embarrass humanity maybe it's just as well that Oregon doesn't have to foot the tab.  Maybe Nevada is, ironically, the best place for them."
570651,"I am reminded of Martin Luther King's ""Letter From A Birmingham Jail"". I am particularly reminded of this paragraph:

We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was ""well timed"" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word ""Wait!"" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This ""Wait"" has almost always meant ""Never."" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that ""justice too long delayed is justice denied.""

Substitute ""homosexual"" for ""Negro"", and it rings true in this situation."
570688,Oh yuck! Now you know why Republican States are poor as dirt. Tax break for the rich (oil companies) and tuition  increase for everyone else
570823,yes  I ca imagine if they just capture the gas from the liberal crap alone it could run the govt.
570836,"The level of stupid this government has achieved in their first year in office is astounding...

Boy I can't wait for my taxes to go up even more...."
570927,"hey idiot, as usual your clueless, the TEA party are mild average people that are fed up paying more and more taxes with more and more government in their lives, THATS IT, but as usual ignorant loser left wingers like you make up bs about them all the time, clueless, you are clueless"
570978,"Well, I agree with you, but certainly Fidel Elliot Trudeau seems, in his own bumbling way, even more stupid."
570986,"these idiots are truely as stupid and incompetent as wynee and company! they have no clue how the grid system works, you  cant ever guarantee the ""electrons"" that flow and make electricity came from any particular source unless you take all other sources off the grid which will NEVER happen"
571148,"And, statistically, there are, as Ken Kesey so nicely put it, ""more dumb people than there are smart people"" in this country.

And, as you should know, there are lies, damn lies, and statistics."
571263,"are really that stupid? syria, lybia, just to name a few all thanks to obama and company"
571324,"Even more sick of people such as yourself that upvote their own posts and hurl insults. Come up with something new, at least ma'am!"
571471,No way. Idiot? You're totally missing the point. Read the rest of the story.
571676,What a knucklehead. How can anyone not know this would be offensive??
571724,"I  am really offended

that no gay or  transgendered Senator has been selected by Trudeau

sarcasm"
571877,"typical liberal trolling bs as daily from you loser.. the DEMOcRATES have become a collection of loons and extreme criminals, fixing elections, buying media ,, the respectfull democrat party of JFK is no more.. super pacs, billionaires funding violence and those rediculous nonsense of fair anything that they never actually want,, are a dangerous menace to society and should be banned from holding public office,, right nazi fascist idiot jimbo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! man you are a sick anti freedom anything left wing nut job"
572054,"And your reminder of that does what? What about the death of 58,000 of our men, many drafted, sent to their death makes you babble off such a stupid comment? Smartass!"
572089,"Where's ""Dave's not here Dave"" to defend the bear's actions against a teenager? It's only a matter of time before a teen or young child is mauled or killed by a bear due to this idiotic ""live with the bears"" mentality that is being used with bears in and around towns and communities."
572114,I find the fact she attacked him for voting what his constituents wanted absolutely stupid being it happens to be his job . I gotta give it to him for not sticking it to her on committing fraud on the Alaskan people....say claiming expenses while on vacation.
572200,stupid comments by infantile  persons don't get replies. And I ran recruitment for years.
572274,Clinton isn't a racist like Trump. So there's zero comparison.
572284,Trump troll...
572308,"Yes, the wars that BUSH lied us into are now all Clinton's fault. Idiotic."
572321,The only person known to have sex with children is Bill Clinton and you idiots want to send this rapist pedophile back to the White House...
572328,"Yes, Vince, forty damn years overdue for a new lineup.  I'm sick to death of what these Republicans have done to our great state."
572510,"Liberalism is what smart looks like to stupid people. Even from a not so good picture one can reasonable detail the lab coat, stethoscope, wild hair wig of a nutty professor in the after math of an experiment that exploded in his/her face no pun intended. 

President Schill and fellow whiners  would be most fortunate if they were to be wrapped together in bubble wrap and floated down the Willamette River. Whereby entering the Pacific Ocean and hopefully drift until coming to a deserted Island where they could live out their fantasies of racial and social injustice without making themselves appear anymore stupid then right now."
572604,Nothing like typical Liberal Rags doing self-analysis of how their Uber Candidate could possibly be so unattractive to the masses. Tone Deaf usedul idiots indeed
572660,"She's someone who is voluntarily leaving office with no axe to grind. I read Pruitt's website and watched his videos. If he ever had a clear thought in his head, it would have died of loneliness. The man is an airhead."
572714,Hopefully he will get what he deserves in prison. A knife around his throat until he bleeds out!!! Prison is a warm place to land for a thing like him. Hope he rots in there.
573062,"It's a shame that so much time, money & concern has, & will be spent (wasted), on a piece of human trash like this young murderer & misanthrope. The DP is far more effective."
573091,Lieberals have run amock
573205,"Can you say Liberal slush fund, what a stupid idea. Try controlling your spending"
573410,we are doomed with ignorant sheep like you
573578,"Yet this ""airhead"" has advanced himself as the next Speaker of the House. Lance reached his highest level of competency when he worked as a low-level employee at Sears. Voters should send him back to Sears!"
573811,"HOW could Trump be 'worse' than a lying, murdering, thieving career criminal that takes bribes from countries that murder gays, treat their women worse than their dogs and stands by as Christians are murdered because they won't convert? Let's not count all the 'mysterious' or 'coincidental' deaths that have followed her since she was fired from the Nixon investigation."
573886,He's an idiot.
574112,"Yup. They could cover that ass-hat clinton all day long, but won't. Yellow journalism at best. Pathetic that this is the only rag in town."
574146,"Keala. Are you somehow slow, simple or stupid? To say Djou doesnt care about peopleand about the finances of the givernment is rediculous. Look at your boy Kirk mismanaging the rail by billions. Making $200k for 24 hours at a bank and 2 million in shares. How is that caring for the people? Thats caring for Kirks pocket. ABC SIGNS SHOW IT ALL AND ITS THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU TROLL."
574282,another useless article by the has been Caplan
574317,"And yet, 39% of the electorate are still stupid enough to vote for these criminals."
574345,"WTF!!@!  Thank god they both survived.  what kind of person drives by without helping or at least calling 911????  what if that was your brother, son, friend.  As for this guy throw the book at his sorry ass"
574390,"It's easy, the average Trump supporter is a racist."
574476,"Wow, Lisa Ho looks foolish."
574681,"We have a serious problem with mental health I this country, and throw I easy access to guns and it gets a bit scary. Thank god these idiots were intercepted. The conspiracy fanatics are out of control."
574698,Even the Russians know she is corrupt and not to be trusted.
574754,"Chase, you do realize that you're responding to the willfully ignorant, right?"
575028,You are an idiot.  Why would any law enforcement officer walk away from a situation that involved threats to the local APSO.
575141,"There once was a troll named Sara
Who would join ISIS in the Sahara

A broke millennial that whines
On top ramen she dines

A trump win will ruin her mascara"
575306,"Lol, such an idiotic comment.  There's junk food sold all over the damn world.   I live in the village and never fed my kids junk like that. My kids have always had good teeth and still do.   Same goes for majority of my friends and relatives.  You compare us 'filthy natives' to the crack whores in the city whose kids are raised on nasty ass junk food (or no food at all)  well, I'd even tip that bigot at Stampede Aviation to bring me back to the ville."
575397,"You are off base Old Bannister. The issue is about a cabinet minister who has lied to everyone including to her Prime Minister, who is now doubling down on the lie to the voters.

FPP by the way is still the best system for changing governments quickly and peaceably. It's also easily understood by all voters regardless of age or education. We don't want goofy messy systems that will keep politicians in power long past their sell by date. FPP works!"
575482,The cost of flying somewhere you have to go to work or live is too high to leave any money for tips. What an idiot.
575581,"I will stand by my statement that liberalism is what smart looks like to stupid people. 

The letter posted yesterday states the real problem clearly enough. "" It doesn't matter if it was protected by the First Amendment."" I have legal news flash for the University of Oregon. Because the University is public and receives government tax dollars it is indeed bound to abide by the US constitution with All OF IT'S PROTECTION INCLUDED. Which should tell everyone right off the signatories are anti-American, and perhaps even anti-America in their twisted PC nonsense."
575670,very glad this hit the news.  hope the guy loses his business.  and gets kicked in the balls.
575899,"LOL, Stupid is as stupid does.  Which is more stupid - dressing in blackface or firing a law professor?

Hell hath no fury like a fired woman lawyer."
575946,"Show me any of my posts that are spam. Put up or shut up! People are fighting back against you negative trolls on here, putting you all on the defensive, instead of coddling you. Don't worry, your time on here will be up soon, TD, Just like SF, who, if you'll notice, is gone as of last night because of her actual hateful and vitriolic spam on every story. You PC folks are attacking anyone that posts an opinion you don't like, and people are tired of it. Happy Friday!"
576095,"You have to wonder how stupid you have to be to put your opinion on social media and not expect to to catch some heat when you bad mouth people.  Its is even stupider when you are in business dealing with the people you are bad mouthing.  Some folks thing it is ok to bad mouth people and not expect some heat claiming that it all someone else fault ie PC police.  The reality of is that his words will not change what gets shipped to the Bush communities but his words have cost him financially and may cost him even more in the future.  What few negative comments can do for something that is really not the pilots concern, if you don't want to deal with locals go back to Texas."
576342,Of COURSE you have a choice. What garbage. Unbelievable. Does your mommy still do your shopping and spoon feed you your meals every day or are you capable of doing your own shopping and feeding yourself? Truly pathetic.
576597,"Racist, white-hating libtard."
576786,If he dies than we will not have to recall &  remove this lying traitor
577060,"Wavetaker? How about call it what it is? That's a cowardly loser who uses another's screen name with a minor change added in a pathetic attempt at harassing the owner of the original screen name.

As the cowardly loser said, ""It is logical fallacy indicative of the absence of a coherent rebuttal."" 

How ironic the pathetic coward would make that statement about another commenter."
577162,"This is the kind of negligent, reckless, idiot gun owner that gives responsible gun owners a bad name. Puh-leeeze....you don't fire a gun at a someone OUTSIDE  who is trying to steal THINGS. You call 911 and stay indoors (with your gun enabled to protect your life or family members if someone has actually broken into your house).  This is about as much a ""fluke"" as someone ""accidently"" getting stone-blind drunk and going for a drive and not expecting to hit anything or anyone. This dude shouldn't be allowed to own a gun anymore than a drunk should be allowed to have a driver's license."
577433,It's none of Trump's supporters damn business.  It's the same as wanting to walk each voter into the voting booth with a gun to their head.
577490,"Take a sh**, or get off the pot!  I love you all"
577862,"Well, the kids are voting with their emotions rather than intelligence and logic. Well done! You're raising emotional idiots."
578018,you just proved old folk can be naive and stupid.
578196,"Yep, I agree Bill. Anyone that votes for Don Young and Lisa Murkowski is naive and stupid."
578295,"It is also none of Clinton supporters damn business, right?"
578697,"One of the lessons from this election cycle is there exist three distinct fashions within the Democrat Progressive Party.

First are the 'No and Low-information voters' which the Democrat Party Elite have labeled as being the""Village idiots"" their own voting base.

Second are the 'sanctimonious hypocrites' the ones who point one finger at Republicans while four fingers are pointing back at themselves.

Third is the Clinton Crime Family with it's inner circle of friends, who Colin Powell correctly identified as ""Hillary's Mafia""."
578722,"I viewed this carefully. The incumbent Repubs and those Repubs that want in won't answer any questions....So, because they obviously think we don't need to know anything they shouldn't get any votes. Vote for those who are bold enough to step up and answer the questions. At least you know they stand for something. Disgusting. Sullivan-Leonard, Stuttes, Stevens, Coghill  and on and on...just disgusting."

If she's bright enough to teach law, she should be bright enough to know the morons and dweebs around her were going to raise a ruckus. But, whatever.

579395,"Yep, stupid EWEB."

580258,"Still waiting for your ""complete knowledge"".  That's the problem with FUD, you can't back up your own BS with any sources.  My guess is that you're a Lockheed shill and you think that your FUD will influence Canadians.

Your useless rhetoric won't sway anyone north of the border."

581182,"The robot censor seems disinclined to accept some harsh truths, but let's try again:

Why is it that despite 70% of serial killers and 80-90% of child molesters and mass-shooters being white, most white Americans are fixated on BLACK crime?  Perhaps its related to a long-perpetuated double-standard that when black or brown (or Muslim) criminals commit crimes, it's held up as a reflection on their entire communities, whereas when white criminals do so, it's only a reflection on said criminals themselves.  And that in turn seems predicated on a widely held and nearly as frequently denied assumption that was first voiced by satan, when his Creator demanded he explain why he refused to make humble himself before 'Adam as he was commanded: ""Anna khairum min'hum--I'm BETTER than him.""

The fact that she will get any votes at all is stunning to say the least but the possibility that she might win is scary not because of what she is and does but what it says of the people who would vote for this steaming lump of human garbage.
581244,"It's as if Liberals don't like jokes, or think that other Liberals are stupid enough to fall for an obvious one..."

And certainly don't turn them loose to do bad things all over again like your President is fond of doing."
582749,So you agree that black children should be killed. I got it. So much for innocent until proven guilty. That is a white privilege too.

585203,"Methinks your ""lying cheating thief"" is the mythical person the Republicans have been carefully constructing for years, if not decades. I cannot imagine a candidate for elected office who has been more examined than Hillary Clinton, and yet no charges have been laid.

It may be more honest were you to say, ""... a loudmouthed obnoxious buffoon or a woman."" That, I believe, is the real issue. The U.S. is less ready than they think they are to elect a woman."
585234,"Not so. 

He exposed:
1. Racism
2. Misogyny 
3. 18 pathetic Republican nominees.
4. Weak Republican leaders, senators and congressmen.

6. That rich Republicans boast privately about groping women."

I find that many 20's folks are polite, many are not, and to most I am not even a person, just an old fart who doesn't matter. Such is the nature of youth. They are largely dirty and ignorant. They have a long way to go. It has ever been so."

Yeah, right...just like the cataclysm that was going to happen after the Brexit? 

You hillary supporters are crybaby losers and fools. You sure ain't a tenth so smart as you think you are. It's really amazing how detached from reality you are. But then, you ARE Marxist Morons...."

Contempt for the arrogant ignorance, disdain for the mindless goose stepping, pity for the unfortunate roll of the genetic dice which results in people stupid enough to think they've found a savior in a bombastic fool, these emotions I feel.

These kids are being accepted to schools like Yale, Harvard, Stanford etc. South is an exceptional school academically and these kids are not dumb.

592550,"Now, you may not think my description of Trump's position is accurate..... regardless of what side of this issue you are on.

Your news media has done a rotten job of reporting Trump's position on this issue to you.

And there are a lot of strident voices out there.... on both sides, who have not really heard Trump either.  It fits their own predispositions (and sometimes their own vested interest) to describe his positions differently.  They do so loudly.  And repeatedly.

But you are silly to listen to those people.

And you are even more dumb to be one of them."

594538,"You, sir, are an idiot."
594585,"My thoughts exactly. Like when Trump was lauded for refraining from the worst insults (sort of) in the last days of the campaign, as if that was a major achievement for a man vying for the position of the most powerful leader on the planet.

Yes,  you might have to leave the country and attempt to come back in legally like so many others have done or go back to your wonderful country and cower like the sheep you are in a corner.

Idiots! The powerful elites' propaganda machine using everything---celebrities, news, TV, movies to condition the minds of society----is dumbing down the more vulnerable younger generation.

They squeezed them so hard to cough up a massive sale price that any one else even contemplating the F-18 will have a lot of second thoughts. In Canadian dollars that UAE deal is worth nearly half a trillion dollars, and that is BEFORE even one missile is fired. The American made air to air are years behind what the Russians and Chinese have. The only missile that is worth anything right now against the huge stand off range that the Russians have is the British Meteor, which the Saab Gripen was selected to carry first."

After a year of working the hospice hall, I was floated to a hall they knew I disliked due to not knowing the patients and not knowing their needs by memory. The LPN's don't help the CNA's at all. Constant new people because they quit after realizing this place is a crap place to work. Not enough staffing, supplies or care coming from LPN's. I only got help from LPN's only a couple times. I had to improvise with briefs more times than what they pay for. The ""higher ups"" tend to treat the careless caregivers well due to them kissing their ass. I would never put my grandmother there."

623707,"Mr Yakopatz, Trump's supporters apparently love it when he ""tells it like it is,"" so perhaps you'll extend me the same courtesy in this comment. Let me be frank: You don't give a rip what a 14-yr old Jewish boy may or may not have done in Eastern Europe seventy years ago. You care about this out-of-context quote from an old interview only because it enables you to marginalize the views of a man with whose politics you disagree.

Therein lies the problem with these boards, if not the nature of political discourse writ large. For too many people of every political persuasion, information is valued only as it can be wielded as a cudgel. Facts are to be deployed not for achieving knowledge or respecting the views of others, but as malleable weapons used to vanquish a foe.

If those of us on the left who support Soros have to answer for his actions of 1944, then may I suggest you, Corbeil, JetRx et al. should have to shoulder the burdens of your man who grabs women by the pussy."

What ""they got"", at a minimum, was someone who at least pretended that they and their circumstances  were worth attention.  They ""got"" someone who promised something which wasn't just 8 more years of the same.  

They were smart enough to see Trump's warts and say, ""I don't care.  At least he won't buy the election with money from Wall Street. ""  At least he doesn't talk about a dead ambassador and his protectors by saying ""What does it matter, now?""  ""He is arrogant but he might use that arrogance in my behalf instead of using it to hide his real beliefs  on a private server or behind closed doors while collecting millions from the fat cats in Wall Street.""

He is a clever one. Everyone knows politiians lie or do not do as promised when elected. Trump, like all of us except maybe Mr. Haske, knows that's how politicians operate. This last round Trump took full advantage of that laying out a list that excited some and frightened others. The fright crowd is interesting as it is like ""phantom pain""...or in this case ""empathetic fear"" for those here illegally. The Wall, the Family Deportations are 2 examples I don't think will be implemented as described. 
Like the Democrats who switched after 50 years and voted Republican...""it's the economy stupid"" that sunk the SS Clinton and it was the Wall that brought out the law and order voters. It was the perfect storm for Trump..jobs and law and order."

629430,"I believe Donald Trump is a sociopath, as many of the wealthiest and most powerful in the world are.  This means he does not have the capacity for compassion and/or empathy, love and the understanding that we are interconnected and interdependent.  Sociopaths operate on adrenaline; the thrill of the adrenaline rush, power and conflict are what gets their interests and attention - it's about the only thing that does, since they don't have normal ""feelings."" Trump's tax plan would boost the wealthiest 1 percent- those who earn over $700,000.00 a year by about 13.5 percent.  The richest .1 percent would receive an average tax cut exceeding $1 million.  The middle income folks would receive an average $1,010.00 in tax cuts.  Trump is a typical lying politician; he says what he thinks people want to hear, then when elected, does what benefits him and his family.  Buyers remorse Trump voters?"

And almost anywhere driving in Canada you can get a CBC radio station when often much else is not on offer.

The U. S. dominated and directed all aspects of life in Cuba from the end of the Spanish War to Castro's overthrow of Batista.. Castro would not take directions from the Americans to put Cuba under American thumbs so they made 20 attempts to kill him.

Simple:  
(1) Build the wall  
(2) Renegotiate trade agreements 
(3) Drain the Swamp.

So in other words, the Liberals are the high priced call girls while the CPC were the less expensive street walkers?     Is THAT the difference?

Face it - ""cash for access"" is a sensationalist way to describe fundraising when a politician attends their own fundraiser.     It's been going on for as long as politicians needed money and there is nothing inherently wrong with it.    Further, eliminating it doesn't solve one damn thing."

People dislike the guise of refugees/ immigrants and the lovey dovey BS that goes along with it. I don't need a lesson on that and it was not even my point. Once again trump and farage and the next eu leaders are very relative to the point of immigration. My second point was the fact that all countries steal from there citizens and launder. We citizens get screwed from every country. You can say the we launder to the USA but it's politicians, republican and democrat.

Nobody would ever tell me I couldn't make fun of them.  But why is it okay for me to make fun of some stupid protesters but not others?  What kind of standard are we using here?

Trudeau repeated verbatim the same vague, simplistic Liberal talking points he and his ministers have been using for a year in response (actually, in non-response) to every question.  It reminded me why I hadn't watched QP in months - it has become a waste of time and an embarrassing spectacle watching The Boy Blunder and his ministers make fools, liars and weasels of themselves.

But yesterday was a new low inasmuch as there was loud and wide spread laughter at the PM when he recited his ridiculous canned spins on the cash for access issue such as that the Chinese tycoons pay him $1500 a head just to be reminded he will raise their taxes and,.

Apparently too busy parroting their talking points from garbage right wing sources to use any critical thought. Blah, blah evil liberal media blah blah. Meanwhile, Trump lied to all of them about putting Hillary in jail and building a wall. But are they outraged? Nope.

712723,"Agreed. You can't reach the lost by being a judgmental jerk who makes kids cry. Christ calls real Christians to be compassionate and come along side people in there darkest days, not yell at them to repent as they come out of the bar. There's a time to talk about the consequences of sin but if you don't be compassionate first, nobody will care about what you have to say. Plus, a position of judgment is the worst place to preach from about sin. Paul constantly used his past to lovingly show that he understood where they were right then and he accepted them. When you can say ""look, I've been where you are and have felt what you feel"", you will have much more of an impact. When people act like this, it makes the world think this is Christianity.

Haycox also thinks that because he can show Trump continually lied - Clinton was the proper choice to vote for. But anyone who reads Haycox knows that he would think Clinton was the proper choice if a super clean and terribly honest traditional republican had run against her. 

Haycox needs to face the fact that even though most of the country finds the current president likable enough and he will leave office with good marks - there is enough unrest in America over federal economic, regulatory, and social policy - to elect someone else besides Cliinton.

    A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,
    Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it
    Wind shadows of the indignant desert birds.

    The darkness drops again but now I know
    That twenty centuries of stony sleep
    Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,
    And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,
    Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"""

Thankfully the founders were a bit more intelligent than you. We the people have spoken, the prohibition of marijuana is a cancer, and it will be cut from this state like the garbage it is."

The FBI admitted as much, but Rush Limbaugh and Shawn Hannity gave the weak-minded among you and those predisposed to Hillary-hating, enough excuses to say that Hillary is still a crook, though you can't point to anything crooked that she has actually done.

We have a client in Waianae that uses some of the same arguments that you just did, DEMANDING her expectation of ""dignity."" This is the same woman that stands (pimps) her skinny 9 year old child on the corner near pizza hut and makes him hold a sign ""hungry, need food.""  People feel horrible and give the kid money.

The upper dam could have been similarly drilled under to allowed the lakes to refill in flood season, protecting downstream property and then used as a reservoir in Summer. We spent millions of scarce tax dollars for the aesthetics of a ""wild"" canyon for a few tourists. Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking. Now we have to spend millions more each year repairing flood damage and building new reservoirs, which will likely have their own hazards, and the animals and birds that had come to rely on those lakes for habitat had to move on or die.

When more than half of US States recognize the medical and far-safer-than-alcohol recreational use of cannabis, then its only a matter of time before the criminal abuse of US citizens will end. Cannabis is now the cash cow of the judicial system and its multiple private contractors, such as prison corps. Hopelessly outdated information that a minority hopes that with repetition will come true, is a fool's game. Belief in the 80+ year old ""Reefer Madness"" propaganda ignores the reality of the benefits and safety of cannabis that has been proven scientifically over and over again. Even the Feds know this but big money creates filthy hypocrisy.

""Police did not provide any information Monday about Harris' whereabouts. A Providence spokesman said Harris wasn't on the hospital's patient directory, and he also didn't appear in an Alaska prisoner database.""

761280,"The best thing Canada can do for its high tech industries is to vote out the likes of Junior, Wynne and Notley..  They are doing more to hurt the high tech and manufacturing industries that help it. They have imposed higher taxes on Canada's highest income earners.  Paying over 50% of your income on taxes is insane.   That effects skilled high tech entrepreneurs, managers, engineer, IT programmers, etc.  Already, the U.S. taxation is far lower for well-paid high tech staff.  More so for other countries like Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.  That gap is going to get wider as Trump is going to lower taxes.  It now looks like Junior may impose higher capital gains taxes which again is stupid as many high tech staff count stock share options as part of their pay.    Combine that with carbon taxes and high energy bills.  .  That also badly effects manufacturing. Trudeau, Wynne and Notley are running huge deficits with no end in sight.  There is no end in sight with their stupidity."
761291,"Carter is honoring the office - even if the next incumbent is a fascist idiot.  After his non-endorsement, I can see why W. is begging off (H.W. had the excuse age). I wonder what the Clintons will do?

Moore, not to be confused with Roy Moore, is joining the religious liberty pander, but at least he knew that Trump is fake. His followers, however, are very tribal and they love their Trump and his authoritarianism, which is not liberty. The line about social dominance is priceless and could easily fit Lori or Chaput.

761927,"This is just another wild attempt by the Ontario Liberals to grab at any money they can, in a desperate attempt to mask how badly they have mismanaged Ontario's finances and resources. In any other country they would be thrown from office and likely put on trial. Here, we re-elect them.

The Wynne government are ignorant, greedy thieves, and Ontario deserves them."
762167,Fools.
762178,"Wynne, there's no need for an expensive, government climate change program.  Your ineptness and corruption has managed to shut down business in Ontario so well that there's no industry left to create pollution.  Fortunately, Ontario's main industry now is the public sector, which hardly creates any pollution, or anything else for that matter.    What a useless person."
762210,"Cap and Trade is a (corrupt) shell game designed to allow politicians to escape real scrutiny of results. There is no simple, honest, straightforward measure that tells you it is succeeding or failing in its murky and vague objectives; it is always full of uncertainties and unreliable assumptions. There is alway plenty of room for rhetoric to make it entirely opaque and we see that with the BS coming from ministers trying to explain it in this column and elsewhere. This is one of those times when I feel like I am from the stupid province and that the West got it right (outside of dumb old Saskatchewan with its ""Wall"" against progress) with straightforward taxes (who can try to manipulate that, but you will be decisively found out). Picking such an impenetrable method of government involvement in promoting solutions to climate change is one HUGE reason to distrust Wynne and is indicative of her manipulative nature."

764089,"In 8 years Obama not only knocked the U.S. down several notches, fulfilling a dream of his mostly absent Kenyan father, but he utterly botched the Arab Spring, Syria and the U.S. withdrawal from Iraq leading to the direct rise of ISIS, was unbelievably weak with Putin, has fast-tracked Iran's creation of nuclear weapons, and has presided North Korea's development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear payloads to American soil.

Basically, Obama has put the U.S. at nuclear risk starting to equal that of the Cold War, has brought the world closer to an all out nuclear war in the middle east and on his arrogant way out gives Israel's enemies even more encouragement to go after Israel.

The man is a dangerous fool - good riddance to him."

Wall rode the oil boom for a while; he will ride out on the oil bust."
765586,Obama seems to have it all backwards. Lame duck for 95 months then a flurry of activity during his last month in power. Where were all these morals during the rest of his presidency. It looks like  his true character is showing through and he  is just trying to poison the waters for Trump.

I fear that one day these drone assassinations will come back to haunt us the same way.  We should always think long and hard before we open up a new can of worms since those chickens might come home to roost.

The U.S., Russians, Chinese, Japanese, North & South Koreans, Brits, French, Germans?

Chief law enforcement executive Obama has taken the NSA light-years beyond anything that Bush started so that they can basically hack everyone's phone calls, emails, faxes and web browsing here on this continent, simply because they can do it, and if they ever need the evidence to arrest and imprison anyone they want for years, American federal laws basically allow them to do it.

The left constantly race baits and classifies people in broad brush strokes based on race and religion. Remember ""white privilege""? Donald Trump didn't invent that concept. Everyday working Euro-Canadians are harried and harassed based on that concept.
Another example, "" He says the voting system is ‚Äúrigged,‚Äù while refusing to even entertain the possibility that the Kremlin... might have influenced the U.S. election.""
Donald Trump was referring to the unbridled mainstream media bias in his accusation of the election being rigged.
What did the left do after the election? Go nuts about recounts, Demand electors break their pledge and accuse Russia of effecting the outcome of the election. 
Let's not forget as well that leftist thought control has always led to a one party system.

First your beloved pet breaks out with silver dollar size intensely itching oozing sores as the tiny near invisible mites burrow into your friend's skin to lay their eggs. Their fur is soon gone from the crusty oozing sores as you watch new sores begin to appear all over your pet's skin. They're miserable from the intense itching. Untreated the animal will lose most of it's coat and become very susceptible to respiratory infections. Really funny stuff. Right? It's highly, highly contagious. Domestic rabbits differ from their wild cousins in that they are much more social and will huddle together, making the parasite's infection spread that much easier. If you love your pets do not let them share space with feral rabbits. Happy New Year."

In that last it does resemble its hypocritical white-supremacist 'patron', the United States. Further it is a non-theocratic yet self-proclaimed ""Jewish"" state in which full privileges are reserved exclusively for European--Ashkenazi--Jews; and concerning the Arabs it treads on, it is no more and no less than an APARTHEID state so oppressive and tyrannical that Bishop Desmond Tutu and the late Nelson Mandela both said it was worse than the apartheid they themselves endured.

You said that the magisterium never changed a teaching. This is a lie. I gave you the specific example of Pius IX saying that freedom of religion was an insanity, while Vatican II said it was a basic right of all people -- you lied when you said that these statements did not contradict each other.

I called you unchristian when you condemned that official of the Knights of Malta to hell for working to distribute condoms to sex slaves to prevent them getting sexually transmitted diseases. (And you lied when you say that you have not said that anyone was going to hell.)

It will not be in the best interest of the U.S. or the world. Russia doesn't give a damn about clean air, clean water, reducing global climate change, human rights, or anything that is important to a healthy future of all citizens of the world. In that way, Putin is as idiotic as Trump. They have the idea that if you poison the biosphere that somehow they'll be able to escape the effects because they are rich.

We all know, because Dumb Dumb Donald told us, this is all something made up by the Chinese. 

Heck! At this very moment there are Chinese submarines herding the fish south. (What's more, Hillary is running pedsphile rings on the submarines. )"
783354,"The big, fat orange fool isn't President yet but he's already making a mess. Please impeach him."
783407,"you are already by far the stupidest poster in history with that bs,, trump is about to get the usa soaring economically, keep crying lefty"
783427,"clearly your understanding of reality has never existed! , trump has already make progress on jobs for the usa loser,, but you keep living in the left wing stupidity world ,,as trump with his team of experienced accomplished businessmen get the usa economy soaring"
783433,"You have submitted 18  posts on this article alone! 18!!!  Me, one. Now, two.  Yours are truly rants with little substance. And you tell me to get ""off the pipe""???  What a joke! You need to get a life Roy."
783563,"Keep in mind Hillary actually garnered 2.5 million more votes than Trump.

And he's right about the big time trouble. Keep in mind there is a little agreement called NAFTA still in place that prohibits what Trump is doing.  Trump is an idiot - it's most apparent, not just with this but with many of his other so called stances.  He can't even deal with the media properly never mind the rest of the political world. A buffoon is being kind, a mental moron is more like it."
783572,"They already know how stupid they are because those voters have been electing Republicans, and voting for policies that wold actually harm them, for years. Plus they elected Trump."
783588,Agree - he knows not what he will sow. I am hoping the rest of his ilk will see things differently. Better would be for them to impeach this moron.
783626,If Trump announced the sky was blue there would be 300 comments here on why he was an idiot.  Saving what is left of manufacturing is not a bad thing people.  Canada and the US do not compete with Mexico on labor with the current system.  Most new infrastructure and investment is going to our far south neighbors with a pittance left for Canada and the US to keep the sheep happy.
784351,Sorry.. Canada. It is just too stupid for the US to give canada or mexico billions dollars trade surplus all the time while the US is going broke. It is time now for a change. US's interest first from the US perspective.
784746,"It's time for the rest of the world to come first. So much for the big, fat, orange buffoon."
784749,"The second this advisor said they will have to use a line of credit to supplement their income I immediately call bullshit. There's no reason for a couple making this much money and living within their means to take on debt like that. They should pay down their student loans faster, and reduce costs in other areas to save for their priorities, but with that kind of income they should be able to live within their means."
784759,"typical left wing ignorance,, trump supports immigration loser, he is against ILLEGALs entering and staying past what thier visa's were, so try again rather than posting the usual stupidity"
784786,I too tire of those meanie Dummycrats hurting our friend Putin's fee-fees.
784847,Where was his respect for the israeli pm? Or scalia? Please dont post stupid comments
784894,"You are a nasty little bugger eh, so how much corporate fraud are you involved in?"
785007,"aa another ignorant left wing loser of stupid, i live in ontario nut job, i respect what trump is doing, i also call for leaders here to act the same, but our current crop of cult liberals is not up to it and dont care"
785093,"Lazee

The US can have all our idiots.  It seems that the US is a country full of them.  They will feel at home there."
785153,You're so dishonest it's truly breathtaking.
785213,kinda nice to see someone with a backbone in the white house instead of the cowardly muslim
785467,"What's wrong with trading with China. At least, they're not governed by lunatics!"
785538,"Pray thee tell why. Or are you the only one that gets to call other comments stupid and get past the ""civility"" filter?"
785552,He's only a moron if he gets caught.
785675,"what BS excuse is that? Nu uh, screwing over Canadians is stupid. Our dollar is also kept artificially low for trade deals rendering the whole Canadian public a third world nation for foreign companies, it's beyond stupid and wrong."
785850,sanity finally in the usa after 8 years of stupdity
786176,"What I am hearing Annie...is the rep strategy is to pass very quickly some version of  ""repeal replace"" on the ACA but date it after the midterms....(and forget the ""replace"").

I cited some data from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .....that note to some degree the dependence of Medicare currently on the ACA....my understanding is that Ryan wants to deep six the whole deal i.e. No ACA, very limited MediCaid and MediCare replaced by vouchers....

Vouchers for Medicare are the equivalent of ""block grants"" for other human services delegated to individuals (block grants are generally delegated to the states). Block grants promise an improvement that they NEVER produce.

The truly naive (and stupid) buy into the rep/Ryan thought that these vouchers will be generous and you can purchase health care with them....

Anyone stupid enough to buy this argument probably deserves them

My hope is that this travesty will get a lot of immediate criticism and be the ""third rail"" for reps."
786298,"You're one of many suckers I see here on any given day.  Tweet, tweet."
786390,Obooba is a domestic terrorist. Nothing he does shocks me anymore. The more he can do to destroy america and israel the better he feels.
786496,"Ok, they are only wrong because they are not updated to be actually more numbers than the article reports - stop your damn lying."
786571,"ha ha ha ha, man thats the funiest and stupid post of the day!! ha ha"
786724,"Trump has screwed over so many companies/people world-wide, including workers in his own country - to even dare call him a ""natavist"" when he's trying to get the population of the USA to pay off his personal debt (before the election) of over 650 million dollars (to now over 1 billion dollars) is beyond corrupt, stupid and negligent."
787108,I had not thought of that aspect Dennis. I hope our military will have the courage to step in and prevent a world wide disaster. By step in I mean prevent Trump from doing something stupid if Congress won't act.
787450,Just the dumbest politician on the Island.  Too bad he's got such an important job.
787578,"Whomever, or whatever you are, it appears you enjoy taking potshots from your fact-free podium. Given some of the statements you have made on this forum, which normally would be dismissed as simply ignorant, I now use your own terminology - LIAR."
787663,"The morons just can't stop stealing from people. In Canada, up to certain amount of income, we have to give almost 50% of our income to the morons. And for the rest 50% that we keep in our pocket, when we spend it again we have to give 12-15% (gst) to the morons. So basically we are left with 35% of what we earn. And these are still not enough, they work very hard to invent a way to dig more from our pocket. From car insurance to property tax, medical to transportation, EVERYTHING INCREASED since the Liberal took over. Let's fight back, let's start from voting out the Liberal (NDP is another moron too), then next let's vote out Bicycle Greg."
787719,"Even if it does strain health resources, is anyone suggesting that we simply ignore the problem and sweep it under the rug as the past government did? 
Whatever it takes, whatever it costs, it's worth it. Suck it up, buttercup."
787984,"I'm  not a 'bigly"" trump fan...but he will  knock some sense into our weak and stupid cdn politician...trudeau, notley & wynn ( for starters).
I love how our politicians bland state that trump's policies will not have any impact on Canada...as we do our own thing.
Well... when the investments, job and tax revenues start to flow south... they are going to have to change in order to able to compete. 
 Common sense will return and all because of trump."
788137,"How old were you when you descended into crankish contrarianism Mark?  If your arguments were persuasive, they wouldn't need to be layered with intolerance of any point of view that doesn't align with your own..

Climate change is not the issue that defines our times.  It is what political charlatans have turned it into that is the issue.

There's not a shred of credible evidence supporting the theory that tax grabs and opaque cap-and-trade schemes have the slightest impact on consumption of carbon based fuels, for which demand is notoriously inelastic.  Europeans pay more than twice our automobile fuel prices, but still produce some of the most ridiculously over-powered, gas-guzzling automobiles on the planet.  How could that be?

Kathleen Wynne has kneecapped Ontario's economy with out-of-control spending and ludicrously inept attempts to game the energy market.  Only a complete fool couldn't see that now."
788169,the ugly face is left wing ignorance on capitalism like yours idiot
788230,"aa poor lefty loser cant stand it still that trump won, keep crying as he does the capitalist magic making the usa economy soar again"
788484,the only things extreme are the damage the libs are doing to our economy and your clear liberal stupidity
788584,Pathetic.

789345,"you are a nut job period, trump didnt steal anything, the russians didnt do squat loser, hillary, obama, the dmc and media who were caught doing the corruption during the election did it for trump!,, get a life loser, you left wingers of hate and stupidity need help"

Trump is a traitorous buffoon.

790787,And another scared useless commie TROLL.
790790,"this guy is an idiot.
I'll disclose I'm male.
but my wife had continual, high levels of ""morning sickness"", as did her sisters.
You don't have diclectin, they're sick and miserable.  You swallow it and wait the few minutes to digest, and they're normally functioning pregnant moms.
The relationship is as straight forward as having a shot of tequila and feeling the buzz in your head 5 odd minutes later.
Not sure what this fellow has missed."
790907,"'
You can see exactly how effective it is by the reaction of those like Minnery.

As long as people like Minnery raise their ugly faces,

791233,The difference between Pence and Trump is the former is a 'benign idiot' and the latter is a 'malignant idiot'.
791380,"You wouldn't be one of these ""liberals"" that believe that all ""post Canadians"" living elsewhere should be able to vote for who runs our country?  Now don;t be a hypocrite and make me call you out on it.   You're a joke. If he moves back to Canada and actually learns French he can run.   He probably won't win, but at least he would be in the country unlike the fools who don't have anything but notatialiage to motivate their vote."

Don't try to predict what an idiot will, or won't, do."

792344,"So silly. This article has nothing to do with politics, perfect time to bash Trudeau?

You are what's wrong with the internet."

792645,"Trump is pretty primitive and unintelligent. He is a criminal, sex offender, liar, charlatan, oafish clown. There is nothing good to be said."
793120,"It that includes killing daughters who make decisions that embarrass the rest of their families, then yes. (See the Shafia's and the Parvez's for examples)"
793265,I'm glad Junior created a new tax bracket so the feds could bleed me more to pay for this stupidity.

794556,"Finally a liberal that realizes Islam needs to be eradicated, or at a minimum reformed. It's he only religion that hasn't gone through reformation, and calls for killing the infidel. Hmmmmmm... as for the others.. you have lots to educate yourself on."
794887,"because at some point, the government will make a decision to cut something.  Cuts hurt someone.  Your comment is basically take it from someone else, not me.  Or, I don't use police, cut police.  Or I don't use a hospital, cut hospitals.  Or I don't like social support systems, cut those ""losers."""
794914,"The books will balance themselves eh, as Justin said. Fools rush in and vote foolishly.Steve please come back and straighten out Junior's mess"
795188,"Mayor Gregor and his cronies have no idea how to properly run a city. They are too preoccupied building bike highways and figuring out new ways of taxing us to engage in any real city planning, transportation initiatives, or even providing basic city services like garbage collection, road ploughing or salting. He's a complete fool and needs to go."
795198,"I'm neither gullible nor stupid.  I voted for Justin and for many very good reasons.   There is nothing to be ashamed of, it was time to be rid of Harper.  That said I will vote against Justin, if the Cons present a decent alternative in the next election.  

You do our democracy a disservice when you insult the intelligence of your neighbours because of how they choose to vote.  Look south if you'd like to see where that train takes you."

796276,"I fought VA, LHIN, CCAC and their Quebec counterparts for a year to get my father a WWII veteran into the Perley and all I got was the run around.  VA and those other agencies are only concerned about self service and not those they are supposed to serve.  My father died before he could get into a veterans hospital. 

VA should have their budget slashed, a new DM brought in from the outside and their disgusting red tape streamlined to serve clients not bureaucrats"
796385,"Who would be stupid enough to disagree with that? Oh, right. Bill G the resident AmeriCON"

796656,"While Muslims excoriate us about supposed Islamophobia, we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, Judeophobia, Christophbia, Europhobia, Americanophobia,   iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient hatreds and wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects are worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump"
796859,Says the scam artist that is lying. You are sick person.
797152,You are a swine.
797190,I am gay as well. And you are an idiot if you think the criminals in Orlando and all Muslims are the same. You do not speak for me.
797323,You obviously are UNINFORMED as to all that Kamana`opono Crabbe has achieved. My mother said to NEVER give a fool more than a minute of your time. Here's Kamana`opono's accomplishments: ...oops! Times up!
797331,"Bubble Guts and Motley, you only mock your own triviality. Hundreds of people died to achieve the 40-hour week, end child labor, and win a living wage. Apparently those things are worthy of mockery to you two fools."
797357,"Sorry Paul, Trump won with 42% of the vote. Most people don't want the big fat rich p***y-grabbing jerk to be our president."
797624,"What is it that you believe I don't understand?  It's very easy to to make accusations like that without backing it up,  which is often the case with individuals whose only religion is the state.  People who worship 'God Money',   celebrities,  athletes,  politicians and/or other false idiols.  
You believe in nothing of substance,  your logic and morality is upside down and backwards.  Your 'values'  are determined by the current trendy whims of your idiols.  You stand for nothing so you will fall for anything.  You are not smart enough to comprehend the metaphors and symbolism in Scripture so you regard it as myth because the literal translation doesn't align with your view of reality. 
Basically your an idiot and as much as I would like to say that is hilarious,  it's not,  it's very sad."
797725,"Well, you know Harold, you can't fix STUPID!"
797794,what is with the idiots from the USA thinking they can call Canadians communist? You are you so bloody stupid about the world?
797824,"Come on Motley, that's garbage. I expect better from you. So my question stands, did Romney get on his knees ""under the dinner table"", to presumably perform fellatio on Donald Trump? Really? Why bring that filth to this forum, whether true or not, and we all know it isn't true, it's just something vile that crept out of your brain.

Sorry, some days I can handle BS, other days, it just seems like trash from hell."
797860,"42% That's the facts, Jack. Your number is wrong, and you are a patsy to believe it."
798108,Hopefully all of the deplorable a that voted for Hillary will be exposed and tortured indefinitely
798215,"Hardly call DeWalt ""junk""."
798226,"Most every other state is able to fund a reasonable level of public services by, you know, paying for them.  Why the wusses on this comment board are so freaked out about paying for street lights, police, education, public safety and every other basic indicia of civilized community life is beyond me.  The anti-government rhetoric is simply stupid.  Grow up people and pay your way."
798592,Incredibly stupid idea. Supervised injection sites have proven to be a complete catastrophe in Vancouver. Lefties never learn.
798757,"It is not a question of would the Conservatives Party of Canada be collectively, politically stupid enough the elect O'Leary. But not the voters. All the hype about Trudeau does not remove the taste left by Harper and his neocons. Of which there are far to many of those familiar faces left on Parliament Hill. We the people of Canada will show the power of one vote!"
798813,I sincerely believe you did get the most important element of this rather silly column.
798905,"save it liar, I read the stats can report, thenumbers don't lie like you libs do,,  ontarios deficit shrinking is bs, based on selling off stuff, not changing the structural deficits between spending and raxes from the economy, thus in 2017, its right back up sky high,,no more hydro to sell off etc... ontaio jobs are flat, no growth,,, its ignorant lib sheep like you that are the problem..."
798929,One idiot so far and it happens to be you.
798937,"From an Albertan...don't vote for the No Damn Progress party.
Our province has gone down the tubes, but NDP piles on more taxes...typical losers."
798953,Is T-rump really this naive/stupid?
799001,Read the whole damned story and stop cherry picking to suit your point of view.
799046,Pathetic. Truly.
799118,"I guess you missed the still net loss of 250,000 industry jobs gone from Ontario under liberals, I guess you missed that the unemployment rate went UP in this report, I guess you missed the record debt, the complete flat economy in Ontario!,,,, Ontario is stuck with plenty of idiots , they are called LIBERALS"
799138,"If that should happen and none of us will still be here but I feel very sorry for our descendants, especially our female descendants. Islam is not exactly known for equality among the sexes. Gays will have to back into the closet. And all meat animals with the exception of pigs will suffer even more at the time of slaughter."
799509,"Don't forget about ""Kentucky Windage"" as long as we're send these fools ""down range""......."
799858,are you honestly that stupid?
800050,A fool's project to pacify the foolish. I'm sure it will be claimed as a job creation and infrastructure improvement project.
800291,Sorry. Damn spell checker and my gross reliance on it! My humblest apologies :-)
800553,"What next?
Are we going to burn him at the stake now?"

800685,"is no good news idiot,things are getting worse"
800689,"TDM.. as usual cant debate against facts, proving his stupidity over and over"
800788,"The American people elected Clinton with a 3 million vote majority; the system elected Trump with Putin's help. How stupid are Trump supporters to believe this big, fat, orange buffoon should be President? Disgusting."
800833,"I voted Trump, I wanted to attend but was to embarassed by my own parties disavow in and doings. The republicans in Hawaii is too shameful. Like ignorant sheeps."
800916,What a stupid time to close drilling in the Arctic.  THANKS OBAMA!!!
800943,and you're nothing more than the type of useful idiot Obama LOVES!
801094,"Considering the Yuan is absolutely worthless ,I think it's best to send China packing. Thank you very much. I will get my fiance tips from a financial advisor and not some dumb Cuck from the globe and mail."
801097,Who really gives a crap about this?  And for those who do watch this garbage: get a life!
801118,Basking in your ignorance.
801318,"I suspect, from the responses to this article, that our 3 stooges are much more than the idiots they portray themselves to be.  Nice cover up, or maybe planted political goons to feed doubt and dissension among the good citizens?   Now is the time, men, THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL A RACiST STATEMENT!"
801502,"Your comment is stupid, but your name is hilarious..."
801823,"""Being black, I wouldn‚Äôt don blackface to educate about systemic racism."" If a black person puts on blackface?"
801915,and iraq has wmds...this is just another liberal circle jerk.
801932,"Hacking in no way altered the outcome of the US election. Unequivocal. It was the uneducated, easily manipulated, rural working class white males who hated the idea of a woman leading the country."
801990,"Because Republicant NRA ammosexuals says that ANYONE can have a gun so that nobody infringes on their so-called 2nd amendment rights.  Let's keep putting guns in the hands of the mentally ill and terrorists that are hell bent on killing innocent, unsuspecting American citizens."
802034,"Right on! The only reason he came out with these ludicrous statements, and attempted to deflect the hacking argument away from the Russians, was  his  ego. He was scared Sh....Less that his election would be over-turned and we know that Trump never loses. What a loser!!!"
802240,I guess the Russians undermined Bernies campaign and wrote Hillary's idiotic emails.
802493,"Excellent, argue definitions, and if necessary, demand citations and references!  Surprised to hear the Church does not teach infallibility.  Are you sure you are a True Catholic, and not one of those cafeteria types.  In any event, we agree, if God  says kill, then babies, pregnant women, whatever, it's OK to kill them.  In His Mercy, of course."
802656,"naked app and Trump are the liars.

The accusations are supported and over a week ago released in a report."
802666,"lol Sheepie .. yeah right .. if Hillary had won and the CIA and FBI and NSA was saying that Russia had helped her, you'd be calling for an armed insurrection to kick her out and install Trump in her place .. you're so blindly partisan it'd be laughable if it wasn't so pathetic"
802811,"Astounding.
 Yet ANOTHER 'report' without a shred of evidence.
The intel bosses are either idiots or they think the world is."
802913,"WTF!

All religions have been forced out of schools yet they are accommodating islam?

Fire all these retards!"
802950,"And do you define ""solid proof'? Outside of mathematics and physics (correct me if there are others) you can never have definitive 'proof' of anything.

You can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence. The question is, why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now? Some people think that it's because Obama's a sore loser, or the intelligence communities want to embarass Trump, or they are simply inept. 

My theory is simpler. There is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the Russians will accrue as a result are considerable. They aren't stupid."

He possesses a keen political instinct that has gotten him out of every bind and allows him to land on his feet stronger than ever whenever the going gets rough. He has street smarts - you'll have to give him that, and I do so begrudgingly. Combine that with Bannon's cunning and proven ability to foment the basest emotions among the lowest wrung of the lowest common denominator, and you have a combo truly made in hell. Welcome to hell."
815979,"Well, Trump caught a wave, as it were, but I'm not sure I credit him with street smarts -- he leaves the street fighting to hired hands. He's a classic bully -- a blowhard in the abstract, a coward in concrete cases (such as the meeting with the Mexican president.) Republicans and conservatives who detested him a year ago have embraced him now because they think he will sign anything they send him; and he will, for a while at least, because he doesn't really believe in anything or care about any of it. However, I take your point; his supporters appear oblivious to his defects of character, personality and judgment; Trump's genius, if he has any, is he recognizes that and plays them for fools.
I reluctantly credit Trump with emasculating Romney. He invited Romney to dinner and served 'Testicules de Romney'."
815995,"First, I don't consider him a troll. As you and others have pointed out, the definition of troll is NOT ""someone I disagree with.""

If he wants to have a serious conversation about policy, then he needs to stop tweeting about Meryl Streep and boasting about his tv show ratings vs Arnold Schwarzenegger's show.

I can only surmise that you have some sort of problem with Streep winning the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2014. Or maybe it's that she's won the most prestigious award in her professional field three times (making her one of six in Hollywood history.) 
M a y b e the problem, for you JimJohnson, is that Streep is an overachiever and a woman. 
Maybe YOU are playing the ""she's playing the gender card"" card.  That kind of ignorance is perhaps what brought us Trump because a lot more women voted against Trump than did men. Maybe it was the stupid, small brained men who played the gender card in 2016 and helped Putin-- but screwed us.

A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth.""

The US is headed for significant inflation within the context of tariff loving protectionism. Do we really need to listen to this mouthpiece for the next four years?

Just look at what happened to Gaza and the last settlers left, it turned into a terrorist haven for pig-headed Islamist terrorists and  a base to launch terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians. When you have a political leadership that rewards the families of terrorists who stab pregnant women at the grocery store, don't be surprised by the skepticism from the Israelis.

The Trumpster is never going to be a legitimate president; he's always going to be Russia's candidate for POTUS, a huge win for Putin, and Russia's intelligence community.

He was described on the programme by people who knew him - devoid of human empathy, utterly ruthless. One person said they certainly experienced evil when in his presence. Decent business people (and some not so decent) wouldn't touch him with a barge-pole.

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich. He also was caught refusing African American's housing, on a massive scale, and at the court case, telling the lawyer opposite, ""C'mon, no one wants to live beside these people."""

An Economic disaster too: at least half a dozen communities have been destroyed as well--they are ghost-towns, now. But not a peep!  Oh, the hypocrisy. But what's wrong with OUR spokespeople (political and corporate) who don't mention this?  Who's for getting Justin to tour Appalachia?

 What MSW and other progressive agitpropers want is to box in the PE with admitting the wholly false biscuit that the election wasn't fair, that Trump is working with Russia to undermine the USA.

It's shameful for MSW to engage in such meretricious and dishonest grandstanding by suggesting that Trump is a traitor.    Dishonest, shameful, junk journistic trash."

If I have to pay any more at this point, we might as well cover those us who are paying the bill for everyone else. We are tired of being called ""selfish"". The truly selfish are those who want health care coverage, but expect their neighbors to pay for it.  We ALL need to pay our way.

For the most part, they know very little about anything and just schmooze with Legislators.

There are over 30 of these non-lobbyists that we are paying every day. When you consider their travel and other costs, eliminating every one would save over $5 million a year. The downside?

He also strongly advocates protectionism. That is so injurious to lower and middle-class Americans  (and beneficial to his wealthy fellow billionaires!) that it should never be allowed to see the light of day.

He uses fear, lies, bullying and deception to achieve his goals. So it's not just what he does, but how he does it that people don't like. They don't just want Trump to stop using his wealth and power to stop grabbing women by the pu$$y, but he's grabbing America by the private parts and they want him to stop right now.

But all through the disgusting performance of them and their efforts    it was worth it all !!! watching election night .The utter disbelief after all their efforts to discredit and  demean Trump and his supporters and he actually won .It was priceless and worth the pain of watching them through out the election process. 
It was like watching Jerry Springer  Show day in day out same reporting and just as reliable and accurate .
We can look at our own media also also not much better  at all . Funny we have entertainers such as Madonna
Cher  , Elton John , all of a sudden now voicing perhaps a way of getting some free press and attention.

  I certainly don't blame only Obama.
The Democrats were always supposed to be the party of the working class but actually never were, since FDR. What did JFK ever do for poor workers.

  Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton also let down the workers. They actually voted for Ronald Reagan in 1980.
   The point is the middle class has had at least 50 years of warning that this fascistic populism built on the increasing gap between the middle and working class was coming. That's why I don't feel sorry for the spoiled feminists marching who voted for Hillary."

As for the demonstration, it was your typical vague, feel-goody demo that passes for activism these days. Bereft of focus, it was just a grab-bag of complaints, much of which was unfair or out of context. Women in the West, for example, have the most freedoms and rights as of anywhere in the world. Yet, no attempt was made to protest true abuses of women these days, primarily taking place in the Islamic sphere. No mention of the sex slavery, or the brutal mass murder happening across the Middle East and Africa. 

Instead, protestors carried signs equating wearing hijabs and burkhas with feminism. Foolish or willing fools? Who knows but it certainly is not feminism."

Rather, they don't believe his opponent in November was any better either with the truth or especially with her positions and her party's platform. Both candidates had extremely high negatives. So I think the bulk of this article is redundant to the bulk of American voters. The United States of America has been a Christian majority country for all its existence and this will not change soon. Nevertheless, because American Christians are diverse and changing and for the most part tolerant, there has been considerable development in American politics throughout our history together.

I would make one point, perhaps unnecessary to most of the Christian electorate. Most American liberals are informed by their Christian values, too."

MILLIONS of WOMEN did NOT participate because we do not believe any of the crap these idiots were hawking and can take of ourselves. Women do NOT OWN a fetus - they do NOT own a child and have no right - NONE - to kill anyone. Where the hell are these million women when a child is slaughtered in partial birth abortion and then the baby body parts are taken in order to sell them. Doing their nails and wearing pussy hats. Women do NOT have more rights than men. Women have the right NOT to get pregnant and every thing available to them for that.

We need to demand they do their damn jobs which FIRST is to get maximum value for our resources.

Their jobs are not to make sure oil companies are happy and profitable, or to make sure that their boondoggle pipedreams really come true.

They refuse to get any value for our oil resources, and listen to lobbyists who declare it a ""flagrant money grab"" if they rollback tax credits.  

So now we have to pay taxes to cover tax credits to oil companies and let them tap the Permanent Fund to pay for things our oil revenue should cover.

The media has the advantage in the first scenario, by using satire.  Satirising overweight, silly men, one with a ridiculous hair style, and the other with ridiculous (if not 'camp') taste in medieval dresses and headgear, could do something to counteract their impact on those who are left vulnerable to their excesses.

The baseless charge eventually ensnared Oscar Chapman, Interior secretary under President Truman, who Schoeppel accused of lying in his oath of office. Gruening and Chapman survived because they occupied positions of power, but, as Haycox notes, many others were not so lucky. Consider the reputations and lives that stand to be destroyed by Trump's self-pitying and imbecilic rantings."

But this same legislature, in its wisdom, allows members to vote even if they have a gross conflict of interest!  That's how we got the current special deals for oil companies:  two legislators who are also executives of a big oil company cast the deciding votes.

As someone who lives in an area with a lot of 'immigrants', I've noticed that children of immigrants seem to blend into the population pretty well (i.e. end up acting and sounding like 'real' Canadians). So unless you are into 'Racial Purity', I don't see too much of a problem.

Tyranny definition: ""cruel, unreasonable, or arbitrary use of power or control.""

The hysteria of which you speak, is what has driven the radical right to respond so irrationally and so out of proportion against a group (Muslims) which makes up some 15-20% of Earth's population.  More Americans are killed by refrigerators than so-called Islamic terrorists, but you don't see Trump and the radical right banning refrigerators. The reason much of the world is so concerned about these developments is that the lunatic is now running the asylum.  A man with no sense of caution, proportion, justice, calculation, or justice.  

Moreover, given the economic and military capabilities the US has at its disposal, this is very much our and the rest of the worlds business, as much so as one must be concerned with Kim Jong Un having nuclear weapons and missile capabilities.  It is a crisis because we now live in an age where reason and truth no longer guide US actions and cannot be trusted."

928445,"culture of hate against Muslims

Is there a culture of that? I will dispute it.

There are many things behind the incident, including things like Florida shooting. What culture is it then?"
928535,"Some of you might have, but if you supported Hilary, you knew deviant Bill would have a second run at the interns. 
It's hilariously hypocritical."
928543,That's because the far-left keeps pushing for disgusting and immoral values and keep shoving it down our throat. You reap what you sow. Not everyone is a racist animal; some people have valid concerns.
928554,"I predict that for every rust belt job that comes back 2 high tech jobs will be lost.  Too bad for the US, great for Canada and the world at large.  Trump is an economic imbecile."
928663,"Jenny Kwan is a shrill politician with the cognitive ability of a gnat. It's these harebrained pronouncements that create serious concerns for people like myself. Why should I invest here domestically when I fear I will be burden with an ever increasing non productive population base that will creep up the existing high taxes even higher? This lady cannot even balance her own cheque book.

Gotta to face it, you can never please everyone. Canada is that country who wants to be like by everyone. It is that facebook user who is out there to collect 'friends' as trophies. And most of these friends are useless and marginal.

It just befuddles me that there is absolutely no political will to lower and remove internal trade barriers within our borders. This should be our first priority. Lowering these intraprovincial trade barriers will create jobs and wealth. These are the pragmatic issues that needs addressing not all this other useless garbage."
928681,"Donald Trump is far from a failed businessman, what a stupid uneducated argument."
928804,"I would not consider these troublemakers ""liberals"" in any fashion; the actual liberals stayed at the peaceful protest.

931159,"Actually, I don't care. None of us is a smidgeon safer for Trump's ban on Muslims. Probably less safe, given how many Muslims are PO'd about this stupid ban. We have a fire sale on educated hard-working Syrians. They will go somewhere, maybe to our competitor nations. This is just stupid. So are you."
931199,"We don't want tax payer dollars from old stock canadians to pay for programs that disadvantage them.  Are you that daft, I don't give a two licks about them my family my friends first thats all that matters.

931463,Like Anthony wiener the pedophile democrat? The one who repeatedly sends pics of his junk. That sick twisted useless waste of skin. Yes that textualist!!!
931523,How so? Government has never done anything good for me. I've worked hard and saved enough to tell Trudeau to shove it. I could go years with a government reset. I'd honestly revel  at the opportunity to see Trudeau get absolutely embarrassed for the complete inneffecient incompetent bozo he is. Not all of us need the governments teet.
931642,"So you think because an intolerant Canadian is born here - they have the right to be intolerant? Ridiculous You want two sets of rules then - you can be intolerant out of ignorance, but gosh darn it, no immigrant can think like you. Do you think they've even lived with protected human rights before like under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms? Are you familiar with the Charter?  Give it a read and you'll find out ""why"" you can't be intolerant anymore. You haven't met too many people from other cultures I take it.... they didn't come here to colonize and take over Canada, they came here to be free. 

I have kids who have zero intolerance - they have multicultural friends and don't even see skin colour. That's taking place all across Canada.... they'll be out-voting bigoted Canadians soon. It's a numbers game now and with right wingers becoming a decreasing minority, no wonder you're against immigration."

931768,"A pervert getting away with a crime is no cause for celebration.  A ""not guilty"" verdict does not make the accuser innocent.  He got off on a ""made-up"" and manufactured technicality.  Thanks to a overly sympathetic & ""politically correct""  judge.

He raped a minor .... forcing oral sex upon his victim.   To the judge I ask What part of that is so difficult to understand?"

932013,Darn it. (edited) ---- Bingo!
932098,"not really 

Canada stands to gain from Trump's policies mostly because renegotiation on NAFTA will be to Mexico's detriment, our pipelines will be built and our infrastructure will be developed in partnership with the USA

Another side benefit  - we now get to play the sanctimonious leader of the free world in america's absence

Case in point the PMO going after Fox for tweeting about the wrong man

Instead of criticizing  the SDQ who made the wrongful arrest  and is rife with racism - Trudeau - as usual heads for the low hanging fruit

All rather pathetic"
932290,the sock puppet will do whatever PM Butts tell him to do.
932356,"Why are those values ""Canadian"" - arrogant idiot.  Typical conservative."
932372,"oh please, where was this type of shock and outrage after other attacks perpetrated by muslims"
932542,"White supremacists are a tiny marginal bunch, reacting to the now widespread notion that the white race and its culture needs to be exterminated because it is irreparably evil, racist, etc.. while extremist Islam gets a pass and any criticism of it gets tarred as ""racist"".

A vetting process that screens out extreme beliefs about women's rights, and a helpline for young women facing the prospect of FGM , is not ""racist""."
932584,NO NO NO NO NO You cannot call Muslims innocent and nothing to so with terrorism then not do the same here. We will speak out harshly against Islam. Arrest me now scum! Pay me later for breaching my speech rights.
932705,"Like I said you can't grasp it. We have to put up with intolerant people here because  they were born here. Is it that hard of a concept. We do not let in those who are intolerant and give them Canadian rights. Your kids will have zero tolerance until your kids grow up and start living in the real world, start paying exhorbitant taxes, exhorbitant prices for homes, food, water, bills, etc. Doesn't mean they'll be racist. Just means they'll learn about debts and how we cannot afford to help every poor soul. It is a numbers game and if you haven't noticed our number is at a trillion and Liberals have been projected at an added 1.5 trillion of debt.  Wake your dumb a$$ up. I studied the charter in school way back when and knew it was for CANADIANS not immigrants."
932710,I think each and every party are a bunch of raving hypocrites.  Where is the action and the condemnation on the apartheid in Israel.  Why is it okay Law Professors and Politicians to take the cowards route with that. But somehow a little easier when you are dealing with an individual everyone knows is a blowhard.  Hypocrites.
933187,"A stupid comment by a stupid person, educate yourself how our judicial system works before making ignorant commentary.

By the way, if you ever get in legal trouble, you would want someone like her in your corner, think about that for a while when you become educated."
933216,Can't get over idiots like yourself who probably hide their envy that Ms Henien is probably way smarter then you will ever be.
933478,How many states and companies have legal action against Trump on this. What will it take for him to admit that it's a stupid thing to do. When his own acting justice director refused to take action to defend his nonsense that alone should have have told him what a fool he was and is.
933501,"No, I'm saying, based on previous comments you've made at NCR, that you're a Nazi apologist. Don't bother responding to my comments. My reply will always be a big ""f*** you."""

But seeing as in addition to calls from the podium to remove people who don't support his message, there were credible reports out of Calgary yesterday of death threats levelled against a young woman reporter and someone waving a noose from a hockey stick, surely we can agree to stop calling these ugly events Levant organizes ""anti-carbon tax rallies.""

939016,The Donald continues on his quest to turn the presidency into a dangerous farce. The proffering of unsolicited opinion and quips through Twitter is at once pathetic and dangerous. Trump is about as funny as a toddler with a loaded pistol.
939131,"The violent protesters were masked. Their political affiliation is unknown. Perhaps they were anarchists. The noteworthy aspects of this story are:

-Berkeley correctly allowed the alt-right kook to speak.
-Some students expressed their opposition to the speaker's views via peaceful protest.
-A small group of masked jerks disrupted the demonstration with violence.
-Police made a judgement call to cancel the event on public safety grounds.
-Trump absurdly threatened Berkeley on free speech grounds after Berkeley permitted the talk.

Passer's objections are hardly representative of ""the left"", and resistance to Trump's idiocy is hardly restricted to those who lean to the left politically."

MY is pathetic, more to be pitied than scorned. His message is right wing cliches that are notable only because they are spewed by a gay man who both encourages gay men to stay in the closet and flaunts his own homosexuality for profit. To protest his appearances is to treat him more seriously than he deserves. On the other hand, of course, people have every right to protest if they so choose. They do not have the right to commit violence, to do harm, to cause damage; they especially don‚Äôt have the right to stop the man from speaking. It‚Äôs incredibly stupid.

Donald Trump is a full-blown, unequivocal LIAR. His leadership of the ""birther"" movement alone earns him that label, which might as well be tattooed across his forehead. His serial lies about the ex-President's birthplace were debunked almost immediately, yet he willfully and continually repeated that false information, to his own benefit, for years. When, at the final moment of truth, he was asked to defend or refute his lies, he gave the wimpiest response possible, neither admitting to his lies nor defending his point.

While it is more than likely that booze played a pivotal role in some of his more dubious actions, it is clear that Leitch's campaign took more than one cue from our neighbours to the south.  I am hopeful his resignation leads to more honourable conduct on all sides here in Canada.

It isn't overly difficult to expose hypocrisy or opportunism in a political opponent without resorting to lies and questionable language whether they are left, right, or centrist.  Let's hope the less than graceful exit of this man raises the bar a bit."

Many of the trolls he uses to flood our social media with have been coerced by him into doing so, often by threats to them or their families.

What I say is this.

What BUSINESS is it of government that some atheists are religio-phobic? What BUSINESS is it of government if those atheists express their fear of religions and its followers who use religious beliefs to influence laws?

I mean, what is next? An official motion in Ottawa that condemns specifically those atheists and seeks their jailing for hate crimes? Torches at the local library to burn the atheism books in piles on the street, to the cheers of religious extremists?

Islam isn't worthy of special consideration until their philosophy changes big time."

This means that the odds of anyone having a hate crime committed against them are extremely rare. We don't need a government motion (with attached government spending - wasteful!) to condemn Islamophobia (a vague and politically malleable term.)

We deserve the right to criticize Islam. Islam is not only a religion, its a political movement. And all Canadians should strive against the political arm of Islam. We don't want another Rotherham here in Canada due to hate speech laws.

When Imams constantly preach death for those who leave Islam, and the pratice of Taqqiya (lying to non-Muslims) is encourage, and women get stoned to death for getting raped, and gay people get executed just for being gay, then Islamophobia makes sense.

Question for Mr. Clark, why is our government passing *ANY* piece of legislation that singles out a single religion?  Canada already has enshrined, in our Constitution, religious freedom as well as protection from discrimination based on religion.  We already have anti-hate laws and even terrorism laws to protect against religious persecution by individuals.

The DA's office shouldn't care, nor should anyone else, if the case hangs over the defendant's head and is a burden to him...a man died at the hands of a man trained to use restraint and for not a good reason. realistically, however, if the deadlocked jury was at least 8 to 4 for guilty on the deadlocked charge, if not more, than it should be retried. even a public defender would concede that at that number the DA

1026927,This is a disgusting comment. There are many homosexuals who live better lives because Justin Trudeau walked in gay parades. Shame on you.
1026988,"Amazing how Canada  is willing to accept the same people being denied by Der Fuehrer Trump based only on their religion.  The rest of your nonsense has nothing to do with the racist, religious bigotry as the heart of Der Fuehrer Trump's drive to turn the nation into a Nazi Fascist Empire."
1027095,"Nope, its a clown catcher, every, time and it, works. Keep pumping your own old bald tires, fool."
1027130,Milo is a self-obsessed extremist crank. He excites a lot of morons by abusing free speech principles to be beyond the pale offensive and thereby make money.  Live  by the sword ....
1027298,"Exactly.  The cost for this hate-filled policy will be enormous fiscally, in addition to the human cost. And guess who's going to pay? It's not going to be Trump.  He's going fund this abomination on our taxes, and money taken from health care and the programs - such as they are - that  are currently in place to help the American people. 

Republicans:  Hypocrites working to make life worse for everyday Americans, increasing government size and increasing the deficit to pay for their hate-filled agenda. 

Where're all the whining conservatives crying about cost? About the deficit? 

Every single one of them is a hypocrite, and worse.  Weak little punks.

1028489,"Oh and in BC, thanks to all the Liberals they now clearcut huge areas of forest and ship raw logs to Asia instead of milling them in BC as they should to support BC jobs.  And they always get other countries to build the ferries instead of keeping the work in BC or at least in Canada.  The latest ferries were built in Poland, and the big new ones were made in Germany, so just like in the US, they ship all the jobs offshore and screw their own people.  Never forget these facts when you vote BC, the Liberals are bad for BC and are not on your side, and like Trudeau and the federal Liberals they lie all the time.  Haven't you had enough of lying politicians like Trump and Trudeau?  Vote NDP or vote Conservative, but never vote Liberal."
1028667,"Listening to a hypocritical cretin like Yiannopolous is the price we pay for living in a tolerant democracy.

I am glad that he seems to be getting his just desserts, since while I firmly believe even wingnuts deserve a voice, I also believe that we have the right to treat said wingnuts in the only way they truly deserve -- with contempt.

This doesn't mean violence or personal slurs that aren't rooted in fact.  But if a man like this decides to hang himself with statements that approve pederasty, or claims that birth control renders women unattractive, we are free to call him out for the odious little troll that he is.

It's early yet, but I am very interested to see the comments of those who approve of men like Bannon and sites like Breitbart here.

My guess is that we will enjoy a refreshing silence."

1029971,"Is it really our Governments responsibility to ensure Mexico is taken care of?  At some point, sometime, can our government focus on what is in Canada's best interest. Even if that means someone's feeling are hurt.  If it is determined that Canada's best interests are served by an issue that may also benefit Mexico, so be it, but it seems that this Government is so focused on how they ""look"" to the world, the country they are paid to SERVE consistently becomes an afterthought.  The scary part however is that few in this country actually give a crap."

Didn't  you know that they only thing these people respect is overwhelming power.  Your liberal BS is what has gotten this country to the state it is now in.  No more capital punishment, no more pledge of allegiance, no more of the good things like we had in the past.  All the crying and complaining your kind has done is what contributed  to making our country the sad thing that it is today.  How about you turning the other cheek and do what is right to help make this country great instead of being a counterproductive jerk?  Quit the bellyaching and putting down the POTUS for a change.  QITMO is essential to our safety.  Those being held there are quite the lucky ones...they get a clean place to live, 3 meals a day, exercise and  participate in their religious prayers.  Win, win for them.  No one is trying to kill them there.  Wise up!!!!"

My daughter will never get that VACINE.  We will take the risk

He has a right o give his opinion, as long a he does not force it on them.  This idea that just because you are not a Dr. or a Nurse, you are not qualified to give an opinion is a JOKE!!  We re all entitled to our opinions because we have had different experiences.

Maybe the Coupeville snowflakes and COER Navy Haters can't handle it because they are infected with liberalism, which has caused them to be overly sensitive to loud, scary noises. If the sound of freedom bothers you, move away from it."

1032144,"The liberal media made the mistake of assuming that all Trump supporters were ignorant hillbillies- look where that got them -  their corrupt, lying candidate lost.  I would put my education and degrees against most of the idiots that voted for HRC, so maybe you should keep your rude comments calling Trump ignorant to yourself."
1032209,"Trump is the ultimate media whore.  ""No one cares what you do you in your bedroom or what your gender is anymore!"" That's funny considering what Trump did today and the fact that there are still sodomy and other laws against different sexual styles on the books. Not to mention those who use the term ""whore""  negatively.  But no judgement, right?  You're obviously a Trumpnut. Why else would you make the idiotic statement that you ""haven't heard any any statements coming from the White House declaring such a mind set exists.? Yes, because Trump is going to come right out and say he's homophobic.  Not that I'd put it past him.  What he has done is demonstrate his homophobia by his actions - always a much better indicator of his actual position than what he says, since he's a pathological liar. Or did you miss that fact?"
1032289,Idiotic. If they want to speed up the game kill the walks to the mound.
1032326,"So one speaks to the US agent in Toronto, says ""oh damn, I forgot my passport"", and the agent is suspicious. He detains you until they can establish your identity. They interrogate you.

1032419,"The mainstream media tries, I mean really tries, once again, to form another Obama action into more anti-Trump hysteria.

1032768,"Well its easy, show me the similarities of the Wiemar Republic, the rise of Hitler and the Nazis as compared to America today other than some superficial partisan BS.  Folks have been flying the Confederate Battle Flag since the Civil War and yet, civil rights for all continue to improve in this country, republican-democracy is still here, and fascism along with communism, was annihilated.  I see and hear lots of stuff in my daily life that offends me.  Heck, a lot of stuff I read here offends me.  A dork flying the Confederate Battle Flag from the back of his pick-up just isn't very high on my list of battles to fight.  Especially since the flag doesn't represent the values or beliefs of ""the vast, vast majority of Americans ... "" to quote Gary Crum.

1032820,"no, merely stupid"
1033018,I live in the Silver Lake area and saw my property taxes increase by almost 14%. My Everett School District taxes alone increased by 22.87%. I have not seen my income increase by nearly as much as these taxes. When will our governments and School Districts learn to live within their means and cut out all the waste? And when will the voters wake up and start saying NO! This ridiculous money grab just might finally wake people up. At least I hope so.

He just wants specific people to be named as sources so that it will have a chilling effect on people coming forward to share information with the media.  It's not illegal to have anonymous sources.

Presiding over a sexual assault case in Southwestern Ontario, Mr. Justice Terrence Patterson of the Superior Court of Ontario ruled that Parliament violated the Charter of Rights with a 1995 law that prohibits the so-called defence of excessive intoxication.
The ruling opened the door for Carl Frederick Fleming, 62, to argue that he was too drunk to appreciate his actions when he sexually assaulted a St. Thomas, Ont., woman in 2009.""

Since 2001 the Liberals have picked up where the Socreds left off and ruled BC to the present day.  Under the Liberal's tenure, BC is now the most prosperous economy in Canada.  We have work and we have success and security.   

The people of BC vote for Socred/Liberals because we understand clearly what is detrimental to our well-being.  The only threat to our security is the socialist NDP."

Goddam there's a lot of stupid bastards walking around.

Carry a little pad and pencil with you. You'll wind up with thirty or forty names by the end of the day.

People who don't see immigrants as a potential positive to the nation are foolish.    *I support 'controled' immigration, not bigoted and racist banning of people who want to live in a growing and peaceful society.

The author is right, this is all about being a white America to people like King.  And if not King, just ask yourself if your happy standing next to cheering KKK members who clearly see him as 'one of ours'."

Welcome to Trump's shrinking pocket of ignorance."
5010894,"Are you saying that Motley ""is the pot calling the kettle black""? That means you are accusing him of hypocrisy. After all, the pot is blacker than the kettle, so if the pot accuses the kettle of being black, the pot is being a hypocrite. That was sort of my point.

On another note, that whole saying has a whiff of racism, doesn't it? I mean it wouldn't make sense if the saying was about the Corning Ware calling the refrigerator white."

  Please don't be stupid.
  Please read with an open mind.  I only wrote two sentences to keep my points simple and straightforward.
  Why are you so uncomprehending ?
  I said the hippies of the 60's and 70's were like today's Netherlanders, social democratic, progressive and ahead of their time, in the 60's and 70's.

 Talking over a football game
 With that same big loud opinion
 But nobody's listening
 Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
 Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
 But all you are is mean

 All you are is mean
 And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
 And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

What I can't figure out is why the people who are supposed to be keeping him in check can't. His cabinet, staff and the republican majority of congress need to step up to the plate and do their jobs. Right now they're empowering the dummy to continue lying because they find all kinds of stoopid excuses to back him up."
5015459,"Our stupid, rigid, and inconsiderate institutional Church again shows its inability to understand the Human condition.  A bunch of celibate (or so they say) lawmakers in Rome wrote the rules for an optional-married Deaconate, and the results are what this story reports.  I'll add another.  I have a cousin, a wonderful man who is a semi-retired police officer, married for 40 years and had two children who are accomplished adults, and one is married with two children and very active in their parish as well.  My cousin applied for and was accepted for the Deaconate program in our diocese.  After about 3 months, he received a call from someone telling him he was rejected from the program.  They at first refused to provide the reasons why: it took some time to learn that his wife, who was unable to adjust her work schedule, could not attend the required meetings for wives, and so they threw my cousin out.  As if we have too many Deacons  in the first place.  Church idiots."

Consent is all that matters imo. No that does not mean grooming someone from a position of authority, that's a smart, balanced ban.
The age thing is a croc, I prefer something like puberty plus two or three or more. More accurate than trying to say all are equal when it is clearly not the case."

5015829,"RD has a problem with anyone getting government funds to help others. He has been told, but won't accept, the fact that private charities are unable to help everyone in need. He would rather the hungry starve, the thirsty not be given drink, the naked be unclothed, the sick die (not, of course, where they might bother him in his private corner where he tends his soul) and the stranger turned away than they be helped with government funds.

He pretends that people go to help others to assuage their own guilt. It is his way of defending his hypocritical attitude towards doing good."

 You sneered at my combat experience, saying ""A lot of so called ""combat veterans"" of Vietnam smelled more perfume from call girls than they smelled cordite"" and ""So when you were an Army officer in Vietnam (even though you spent your time inside of Danang airbase, with at least two battalions of infantry marines on the wire ) what was the combat load for M-16 ammo per soldier on a daily patrol?""

However, neither McConnell nor Ryan makes much effort to disguise their contempt for Trump, even as they (Ryan especially) fawn over him to get the healthcare farce passed. It is not hard to see that at some point, Trump will no longer be useful to them; he'll merely be an idiot. They'll turn on him in a New York minute and gleefully embrace President Pence.

What it doesn‚Äôt show is these figures I present. You must work to get these. Is that deliberate? It also doesn‚Äôt show how many self-employed people there are, people that might be making way more than the minimum.

So he lies and claims he doesn't believe the science, which sounds more legit.

What I don't get is all the ""family values"" people who are always the first to chime in with ""but what about the children?"" not caring about climate change now. It's clear to me as a gay person that ""family values"" only ever meant ""no homo,"" but still, you'd think that conservatives really would care about the world they're leaving their children.

Written on the wall was ""If you're poor enough to be using this crapper and you thing Bush really cares about you,  you are really, really stupid.""  Trump won with millions of votes from white working-class voters who simply voted against their own self-interest.  As that graffiti so succinctly put it, IMO, that was an ill-considered (that's PC for stupid) thing to do.  

We now have an administration dedicated to Laissez Faire capitalism.....Gordon Gekko ""greed is good"" style, unfettered free market capitalism.

The real question is why do you insist on sticking your head in the sand and pretending everything is tickety-boo in the world today?  By the way, that's exactly the type of thing which Neville Chamberlain advocated and did before WW2 and we all saw how that situation ending up getting resolved.  

History is doomed to be repeated when fools like yourself ignore what's happening.

The Crimea was clearly invaded by the Russians and stolen. The Ukriane has already been invaded by Russian forces and weapons, but the fight is far from over there. 
The Russian military is no match for Western forces, except for their tank division. Every other part needs major upgrades and with sanctions, money is tight.

  If that isn't something to fight against, I don't know what is.
The ""spirituality"" of Christianity is an acquired taste to which the vast majority of the world has no attraction.
 The world desperately needs a spiritual revival to rejuvenate the reality of shared common humanity. But religions are not doing it for us.
   In the 1960's and 70's the hippies had an amazing kind of spirituality - a generous spirit of love for humanity, inclusiveness, and peace based on social democracy.
  That spirit still lives in the Scandinavian nations.

People are killing each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit.

Hitler did it. Mao did it. Stalin did it. Lincoln did it. Pol Pot did it. So did Ivan the Terrible. The native tribes of North America did it. The British did it all over the world. 

The ""trample on other"" instinct is very powerful in humans and transcends religious beliefs. That is how you have Christian whites in the southern USA slaughtering Christian blacks in the southern USA, and how you have castes in India of the same religion trampling upon one another, that is how you had the north and south in the American civil war having the same religion.

People kill each other in order to obtain or preserve power over the masses and to shape society and harness resources as they see fit. That ""trample on other"" instinct is actually the core and key problem, not the matter of whether others worship trees or have darker skin."

Liberals support ""race politics""  and so close the door on rational debate. Politics becomes a football for racialists and revolutionaries calculating redress and measuring imbalance. Liberals practice birth control, which ensures they will not spread their luciferian doctrines beyond this benighted generation. Liberals thrive on the largess of a functioning society, so of course they do what they can to undermine and dismantle the very civilization that tolerates them.

Liberalism is a disease of the wealthy and idle elites, much as Enlightenment was the disease that spelled doom for the Middle Ages. Every civilization has a healthy ascendancy and a sickly decline. Liberalism is our swan song."

The fewer collectors of a tax the better, and there are much fewer businesses to collect a sales tax than there are residents, who may or may not honestly pay an income tax There are a LOT of income tax cheaters and to enforce collection of income tax requires a new State agency. 
Auditing businesses who collect sales tax is very straightforward and very few businesses of any size cheat on sales taxes. 
As a person increases their income, they buy more expensive items, therefore they pay more sales tax, Most states eliminate groceries from sales tax, so as to not unfairly hit the poor, so the sales tax is on items people CHOOSE to buy. Rich people buy planes, expensive cars, expensive homes, expensive ""toys"", remodel homes, buy new appliances, etc. and therefore pay more sales tax."

Unemployment insurance? Old Age pensions? Even universal education comes from religious people and not from secular capitalists.

Solid accounts by rare seminary or chancery personnel underline this reality. Yes, concupiscence is a function of humanity, so let's start such conversations by being compassionate and, where required, forgiving. But we must also acknowledge that the sideways living of enough priests, and the bishops who manage them and who themselves live less than integrated lives, give cover to those in their ranks who engage in criminal, and not merely immoral, behavior.

Of course the guy is not an idiot, or stupid. He is a successful businessman in America. He did it the uniquely American way. But he would not be that successful if operated overseas. He would be in jail.

So this is hardly a case of anyone invading the privacy of his home, as you have so falsely claimed here.   They had great big signs outside, and were standing right on the street curb, to get attention from the people driving by.

Had I a child who had been charged, I certainly would have done anything in my power to get my child off the hook. That's why the law has to be changed. So stop pointing your hypocritical fingers."

The costs - social and economic, are real and avoidable. Any police service still making such arrests appear foolish and wasteful to reasonable Canadians as we legalize the stuff, and while bureaucrats and politicians take executive positions with pot growing firms. It's time our government and our police show a mature approach and end this waste of public funds, criminalizing what is to be legal."

Last, Every other state had a up and running medical system in place and working great and then brought the rest in. Alaska has said F-YOU to ALL medical even though they have been giving out medical cards like they were candy for 20 years but never had a place to get anything not even a seed. Now you want a criminal, Look no farther than the white house. He brags about abusing women and walking in on naked teenage girls. In most states and FEDERALLY that is a FELONY.

A Pope who is called ""a goddamn socialist"" in America is a very good one.  Ayn Rand's philosophy has succeeded in infiltrating the thinking of many who call themselves Catholic or Christian.  What it actually does is creating ""economic Americhristianity"", which is universes apart from true Christianity as expressed in the Gospel. Maybe Pope Francis needs to make an authoritative statement to that effect, in form of an Encyclical, written in English. Title: ""With Grave Concern"" (respectful thanks to Pius XI)."

So no, it is NOT Front Nasionaal's ""right wing"" boycott that's to blame. Spur caused the boycott by ignoring facts and taking a racist position against a white man. Firstly, the black woman's older son beat up on the white man's much smaller daughter. When she was asked to discipline her child by a concerned father, she started swearing at him like street walker and refused. He got angry at her and pretended that he was going to attack her. He never actually attacked her - he threatened by making certain gestures in order to intimidate. And Spur goes completely crazy, taking her side - the mother of a disgusting little bully who should have been given a hiding. Because she's black! Spur will never see me again. If they are so pro black people without any manners, let those support their business!!! Idiots!"

Really disappointed to watch a 2-hour PBS show about Lyndon Johnson and learn that there was NO attack on an American ship in the Tonkin Gulf. It was raining hard and the radar was just showing a lot of static. So they decided to shoot everything they had at everything and anything. The next morning there was no evidence of debris or oil slinks. They make a mistake. Johnson was running for re-election and was tired of Goldwater calling him a coward. So he bull-lied and said we were attacked and took the opportunity to declare was and win re-election. What a bastardo. So many young men, women, and children lost their lives just because a President lied. There are still hundreds of thousands of live bombs is Laos waiting for future chid victims to maim and kill.

They show up at a pizza shop with a gun, endangering the lives of many people. Just as a man showed up at a Planned Parenthood clinic last year, killing three people, believing the lie that Planned Parenthood was selling baby parts. The Seth Rich story is yet another lie promoted by right wing conspiracy sites.
People will be hurt because of these lies, but they will continue to spread them because this is an agreement they have implicitly entered into with the internet: it provides them with the content that justifies their hate, they provide the clicks that pay the bills of the fake-news con artists."

5294667,"From listening to the dems and FakeNews.com you would think that the Russians are threatening our way of life and our democracy.

5295857,"Given his political bent and journalistic background,  Martin's tribute to the US liberal establishment (an Unholy Trinity of  Democrats, bureaucrats and media) in its effort to subvert the will of the American voters expressed just months ago is not surprising.

Martin applauds unethical traitors in the bureaucracy illegally leaking untruths, partial truths, unverifiable allegations and other anti-Trump garbage to bring down the new president, force a real constitutional crisis, and spit in the eye of their oath and of the ordinary people to selfishly maintain their privileges and power.

He waxes enthusiastically over an increasingly hysterical, dishonest and despicable media for their Pravda and Izvestia like propaganda to demonize Trump  and ensure a one party state of self serving liberals.

He is OK with Democrats abandoning even the pretence of seeking legislative compromises in the national interest.

The party has forgotten the general group has the ability to make up their own minds on those types of decisions.
So, along comes what should have been the most laughable candidate in history, but, instead he has the biggest laugh in history, disassembling the ""Grand Old Party"", and making fools of the mules who chose to put forward their own parade of what ""should"" be acceptable to a nation that can freely choose that themselves.

(a) The person subjects another person to sexual contact and:

(A) The victim does not consent to the sexual contact; or

(B) The victim is incapable of consent by reason of being under 18 years of age; or

(b) For the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of the person or another person, the person intentionally propels any dangerous substance at a victim without the consent of the victim.

(3) As used in this section, ""dangerous substance"" means blood, urine, semen or feces. 

10 years ago I knew a Lane County Deputy that went to work one day and when he went into his office he passed by his secretary, said Good Morning, and put his hand on HER shoulder as a friendly, warm gesture. She filed sexual abuse, she won, he was fired.  What about a hand shake?"

You are right IMO that Andrew gave a crackerjack speech on Friday especially in his attacks on The Clown Prince.

Probably Scheer will get even better sharpening his attacks on Trudeau  and this is vital to success in 2019 since the media will mostly continue to give Justin a free pass and since the popularity of the Liberal government is pretty much all Trudeau and his celebrity.

A flat economy in 2019, more moronic and embarrassing behaviour by Trudeau, a huge accumulated debt,  more broken promises and at least a modest revival of the NDP will make the Liberals vulnerable.

Assuming voters decide they want change and conclude the PM has failed to meet expectations, a strong campaign by Scheer will bring victory.

Being Trudope hasn't changed anything policy-wise I'm wondering why there are no longer claims from the left that Canada is still subsidizing this ridiculous number?

That process is both political and judicial, and it necessarily involves a full explication of the evidence, and provides for the president's right to mount an aggressive defense. If he survives that process, then so be it; but if he is removed, it is utterly important for the evidence against him be laid out for the people of the United States and the world to see.

5344562,"No, I am really not. Philosophy - from the Greek ""philos' meaning love and ""sophos"" meaning ""Wisdom"", the love of wisdom - is literally the study of how to think straight.

If you haven't learned philosophy, you will never be able to form a logical thought. No, what people think they are doing isn't logic. Logic is a set of rules. To think logically you have to know those rules, and apply those rules (much like algebra is a set of rules you have to know and apply to get the right answer).

To think you can be logical without studying philosophy is like claiming you can do algebra without learning to count first. 

Here's how it works:
Philosophers figure out how to understand things.
Scientists use those techniques to understand a particular thing.
Engineers use that understanding to solve practical problems.

Unfortunately - because true logic is so often counter-intuitive, those not schooled in it tend to think actual logical arguments are ""stupid"" because their intuition says so."

You want to talk about responsibility? Go ahead!

Wow! A 1% slowing down of global warming after 80 years!  In other words, it would make a tiny difference.  THAT'S ""IF COUNTRIES ABIDED BY THEIR PLEDGES IN THE DEAL!""  A non-binding agreement that has no teeth.  Let's see, I wonder how many countries would keep their promises when nothing would happen if they didn't.  I would bet the U.S. would be one of the stupid countries that actually kept or tried to keep their promises while the rest of the world laughed at us.

My concern is not necessarily about the science or having policies in place to protect our environment.  My problem is with how you go about doing it.  The Paris Accord assumes all countries will comply with the pledges they made even tho there's no consequences if they don't.  Look at NATO.  Out of 28 countries, only 5 contributed to their defense as promised.  There are no consequences for the other 25 countries that violate the agreement.  Out of 194 countries in the Paris Accord, how many would you guess will comply with the agreement?  The U.S. for sure, because like NATO we are the stupid rich kid."

But it appears that's what they are. 

I don't get why, if public marijuana use is prohibited, an event whose primary and traditional purpose is to have a large group of people use marijuana in public is given a permit as if no one will light up. Does someone at the City not actually know what a 4/20 event entails?  It's like permitting a beer festival and and trusting that no one will consume alcohol.

The complaint that no one actually got sick or injured? Is that a requirement for banning an event/organizer, or is there discretion that the city doesn't like how it went?"

But by opting of an international agreement (that he can't *** really*** opt out of anyway, he is declaring that he doesn't care about his own grandchildren, never mind yours. He is denying that the ice caps are melting and he's declaring that he doesn't give a damn if they are.

It is a FACT that the first plastered walls were built by the SAME early farmers who also built the first grain stores. Agriculture allowed, for the first time, overproduction of food - so working for a few months a year would provide food for the rest of the year. Plaster was a major thing - it has ZERO survival value. It takes days of backbreaking labour, maintaining a fire at very high heat constantly - for no reward other than aesthetics. It's something that would never have happened in a society without an abundance of leisure time. And it's important that it did - the same fire-handling techniques they developed to make their walls smooth - was what allowed their grandchildren to smelt ore and end the stone age.

5360985,"'Alt-Libs' makes no sense as a term. 'Alt-right' has a clear designation (the lunatic fringe in the U.S.). Liberals are centrists generally, so you can't just attach the prefix 'alt' and call it a day on the witty riposte effort. Anyway, it's possible to be very worried ('hatred' is not even remotely the right word) at the same time about the attacks AND about the latest hardcore (incontrovertible, verifiable) evidence that Trump is loud, understands little, and has shockingly (stunningly, breathtakingly) weak reasoning skills. Heck, some 'Libs' can focus even on several MORE sources of information/horror at the same time, more even than two! Unlike Grandpa Pageant Lurker.

5362431,"Trump is the most corrupt president in US history. It's a fact that he is the only president in history NOT to fully divest himself of all previous business dealings and assets - that alone makes him Zumaesque and is almost certainly a violation of the constitution's emoluments clause. And that was before he was even sworn in. On the day of his swearing in he stood in front of the world and flat out lied about how many people attended - as if we hadn't all SEEN that he was lying.
This is a president who lies habitually and actually seems to think that if he says it, reality must change to match what he said. 
Now, in the meantime - yes, this coverage over Russia is absolutely critical. As I've pointed out before - it took nearly 2 years from the breaking of the watergate story before Nixon was forced to resign and part of what allowed that to happen was constant press coverage. 
Stories likes must NEVER be allowed to blow over. Cover it. Constantly. Until he is exonerated or impeached."

2) Alberta gets to pipe toxic sludge into BC where all of it gets shipped out of the country
3) Alberta corporations get rich
4) BC gets a seven fold increase in tanker traffic
5) BC gets virtually all the risk when (not if since it WILL occur sooner or later) a pipeline breaks
6) BC gets to deal with destruction of the coastline when (again not if) a tanker leaks/breaks (with ""some"" help from the federal government but not as much as would be needed. It never is.). 
7) BC gets all the responsibility, work, and blame to clean up and restore fragile coastline ecosystems
8) BC gets to have it's major industries (tourism, coastal tours, whale watching, parkland vacationers, etc..) ruined with the damage and destruction of the coast

5366735,"Well said.

Regardless of the reason, telling people in a country that has been attacked three times in less than three months by Islamic fanatics ‚Äúnot to be alarmed‚Äù is the height of irresponsible stupidity.

There are indeed so many citizen see-something say-something reports of Islamic nut jobs that need watching, this tsunami of citizen reporting has totally overwhelmed the resources of MI5 and British law enforcement. There are no near term prospects of things getting much better either, not until major budgetary outlays can be conjured up to massively expand law enforcement resources in the UK.

Those who seek to blame all this on our PRESIDENT are merely confessing to have succumbed to TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) and should seek psychiatric intervention.

Bottom line: until the UK quits molly coddling fanatics who are the source of this problem in the feel good pretense of ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù, more British blood is going to flow."

They can't believe how Trump has screwed things up so spectacularly in the last four months.

At the end of this, the people of the U.S.A. will not be ""thinking"" much about this single leak we are talking about.

I don't think he's far off from those hoodlums. It doesn't take much from either radicalized side of the political spectrum to set someone off.  The difference now is that these morons see themselves as a part of the political story, a story they don't have a basic, high school civics level, of understanding. Look at the posts here, immediately the right jumps to this moron's politics as the reason for the shooting while the left comes to the general defense of his politics, or strains to make this about Trump or guns. There's no one reason for this and all cited things played a role and are independently supportable, shooting or not. Of course this lunatic shouldn't have had access to gun, of course Trump is a goofball and shouldn't be President and of course the left radicalized this moron.  Mix it all up...viola a shooting."

It's not. Hodgkinson has done more damage to his cause than any politician has ever done to it. He's a fool. His choice to break out a firearm and attack the Representative is _exactly_ what we criticize Team Red for doing, and now, we here on Team Blue have lost a valuable counter-argument. Thanks, James! Bang up job you did. Now we have to fight to regain the upper ground, which we had until...this morning and your first shot.

""We led by example with the first ever gender-balanced Cabinet (and with) the first feminist international-assistance policy [which sees the VAST majority of Canada's foreign aid aimed at women and girls!!!]. Science would benefit from adopting a similar approach...""

Hello?

Does the writer think Canadians are blind, lacking in memory?

Look, when Justin Trudeau came to his senses months later, he TERMINATED women cabinet ministers from their posts for lackluster performances and REPLACED them. VERY EMBARRASSING and VERY MALADAPTIVE MESSAGE for gender relations in Canada. 

And the writer wants to bring THAT MESS to universities? With SEXIST grant funding akin to Liberal foreign aid ?

Read AT's sequence of events - the drunk glared at AT, but after that AT escalated first, at every step of the way. What would have happened if AT had glanced at the man, seen that he was a sitting drunk, and just walked on? Nothing! That's so easy! Maybe the drunk would have cursed or something, so what?

Andrew Weaver painted his opponents as hopelessly compromised for accepting union and corporate contributions.  During the recent provincial election campaign, B.C. Green Leader Andrew Weaver made a big deal about the two major parties accepting corporate and union donations.

‚ÄúB.C. Green Party banned corporate and union donations because it was the right thing to do,‚Äù Weaver said in a January 16 news release.

But today, Globe and Mail columnist Gary Mason revealed that Weaver‚Äôs party ‚Äúwas hitting up a prominent member of the Vancouver development community and major BC Liberal Party donor for a $30,000 contribution‚Äù. The developer reportedly turned the party down.

I'd never have been able to go to university if the Tories had remained in power. And for those of you that don't believe me, I'd suggest you watch the 'Call the Midwife' series on DSTV, which is set around the late 50s and early 60s.

The way they operate is to expand their business and move in through opportunity.  They've never displayed the global colonization behavior that our country and Europe has...not even close.

Control of the region assures dominance of the dollar, a dominance essential to the survival of the U.S. marred in deep debt. Degrade dollar hegemony and the debt blowup will make 2008 a firecracker. This is the single most important reason for playing such deadly geopolitical games by the U.S.

Second reason is strategic encirclement of Russia and China. Troops - yes, bases -yes, missiles - yes, create a mess for them - yes. But the biggest 'ammo' is to create Islamic terror uprising of epic proportions right on Russia southern border, on China western border. That's the strategy.

""Climate Change"" is the closest thing there is to a world religion.  Even the DPRK has signed on to the Paris Accord, not of course, that it really affects them in any material way.

Giving notice to withdraw from the Paris Accord has been a complete disaster with respect to the allies we desperately need during this extremely perilous time.  The U.K., France, and Germany are good examples of this.

Trump should have simply smiled and pursued the tact that Xi & Modi have -- i.e.  tacit agreement but still acting in their nation's best interest.

Since Bannon helped to orchestrate Trump's upset win he's certainly not an ""idiot"" with respect to grass roots politics.  He might well be deemed an ""idiot"" for the disastrous effect his climate change stance has had on our geo-political security.

Do you have any specific examples which prove that Bannon is a ""racist?""

It was Hillary Clinton in the presidential debates who repeated the most brazen lie of them all: that the Russians weren't fighting ISIL (or Daesh as Chrystia Freeland would call it) in Syria. It was a terrible disrespect of the memory of all the passengers and crew on a Russian passenger plane shot down over the Sinai as revenge for the Russian campaign against ISIL. Trump and the truth aren't close friends, but Clinton is worse."

5496106,"As I watched 9 more pre-orders roll in today, I had to think, darn, that's 9 more traction non-indicators for Steve.

Your opinion that pre-orders aren't a viable traction indicator is, frankly, nonsense. We clearly articulate preorders as ""strong leads"" in our offering circular. They are-- anyone who's put cash down, refundable or not, is a much stronger lead than someone who merely signs up for a test drive. Yes, we still have to build a compelling product, and continue to communicate that product to our pre-order customers. While some will certainly fall off, to me it seems likely they will more than be made up for from folks who are unwilling to place a preorder on something that is not yet in production, which is a very common refrain we hear.

Anyway, thanks for the positive home-town encouragement. Means a lot!"

But the rape of boys by priests isn't 20%.    It's 80%.   Since the 1950s, 80% of the cases of child rape by priests were same sex attacks.

This can only mean that gay priests are far more likely to sexual predators of young people.   Heterosexually oriented priests, as a group, tend to be far less a risk to children."

It doesn't matter how partisan, stupidly liberal, and shallow Morning Joe is, or that these two hosts are typical coastal libs, it's beneath the office of President to get into these little spats, period. When people try to justify Trump's stupidity they sound like parents of a misbehaved teen, trying to cover up the objectively bad behavior in a stage of denial.

How can this guy be an ""advisor"" to Homeland Security and say videos on social media and believe ""no one would perceive that as a threat?""  ISIS release videos on social media to inspire terrorist acts all over the world and Trump has more than his fair share of believers in even the most incomprehensible conspiracy theory.

China Sea islands, and Putin is trying to distract from both Syria and the Ukraine. PRESIDENT TRUMP is skilled and knowledgeable enough to handle both of them. China does not want a real confrontation due to the N. Korea refugee problem, plus the potential U.S. presence on a unified Korean peninsula. Putin does not want the losses that he would sustain in a Baltic operation. However, N. Korea provides a thorn in America's side that they can control.

Maybe Congress, both the Democrats and the Republicans, can mature enough to support a legitimately elected U.S. President. As far as the media, those clowns are there for our daily enjoyment derived from their moronic comments.

One would think the financial/economic whiz kids would be happy that one or two mmbpd of oil supply could be brought on as a safety valve for political/facility disruptions given that it takes ten to fifteen years to bring online any significant amount of incremental production.

However, even as they watched their own comrades lay bleeding and die at Khadr's hands, the US medics worked on Khadr and saved his life.

I am not sure that is craven enough to count as ""cowardly"" and Wente is letting her bias show with that comment.

Like it or not, Khadr has the law on his side. I think settling now probably means we pay less than if it had actually gone to trial. The fact that a settlement and apology are necessary relate to the actions and decisions of his predecessors: Chretien and Harper.

But the real difference is that Charles may have fought to defend his country, Khadr is a Canadian citizen who worked in an improvised explosive device (IED)factory to build bombs to kill Canadians and it allies.  He is definitely a traitor and should be held accountable for that.  
Khadr, the traitor is getting $10.5 million.  155 Canadian soldiers were killed by the same sort of IED that Khadr built and the maximum payout to their widows (I believe all were male, but females did give their lives for their country) was a one-time payment of $360,000.  Why does Khadr deserve on 27 times the payout that the widow received.  Quite frankly, he doesn't.

His speeches and virtually everything else he utters in public are carefully prepared by smarter and more experienced people in the bowels and the Butts of the PMO and are then reviewed by one or more others.  If the speech is important enough, as this one probably was seen to be, key cabinet and deputy ministers may also input and review the speech.  As a former drama student and drama teacher, Justin's one talent is delivery and he sounds like he actually knows what he is talking about.  If only it were so!  Oh well, he fooled you.

I am baffled as to how any rational person could contend that The Doltish, Dimpled, Dilettantish Dauphin from 24 Sucks Us Dry has the common touch while actual folks born, raised and remaining part of the middle class like Scheer and Rempel do not.  Perhaps it takes a special kind of stupid."

I suppose the president can declare a constitutional crises and ""dissolve"" congress and then rule by decree. But do we want a dictatorship?  The bill of rights gives the people the right to throw out the Government if it should become despotic or in some way unable to govern.

Walker would spend another term in Korea or China trying to sell Alaska gas that can't compete with the many other LNG sources in the world.  And Walker would neglect the re-making of Alaska from a $100 oil to a $45 paradigm, and spend his time on his pet fantasy project ... like he has done his entire term.  At least Dunleavy knows what the word ""cut"" means. He would cut too much in the view of the Alaskans (people like Cole and Wohlforth) that think everything should be free and government should be huge.

5611355,"Trump and Co are greedy morons. The time will come when they will profoundly regret their greed. Their stupidity on the other hand is something they will regret but can never remedy. That's just how they are: as intelligent as fence-posts. They are as dense about their economy as they are about the health and well-being of their citizens. If they pass this stuff into law, they are toast."

Three examples are the riding nomination events the results of which were appealed. Despite contestants having broken the rules of the PC party the appeals were disallowed and the ""winners"" were accepted as good sound party members. Newmarket-Aurora comes to mind where ethics is obviously not a word in the riding dictionary.

This hardly is a vote of confidence for a young career politician who enjoys running marathons and marched in the Pride Parade. Are these latter two significant experience?

I would rather have experienced corruption any day, people with policies, no matter how misguided from time to time.

Brown is a patsy without character or conviction."

5611522,"What's completely laughable is that anyone is surprised by Republicans slavish loyalty to Trump--a traitor to American democratic institutions--and a thief, a man who is using the office of the President of the United States to personally enrich himself. Donald is the poster boy of the lawlessly greedy super rich. Many Americans are rich even super rich but they believe in American democratic institutions, believe in paying taxes, believe in following the law. The Republican party is like Trump and has no respect for individual Americans as people. Like Trump, they see average Americans as objects to be used and abused and so that's what they're doing to us. They deserve what the aristocracy in France received for similar sentiments towards the French people. Trump thinks he's King but he's just a rich scumbag."

While there are complaints about the line being perceived as perpetuation of an ancient stereotype, it's also clear that Jay-Z's thesis is that to overcome oppression, black people should emulate Jews in America by accumulating inter-generational wealth.  Whether you buy the capitalism as cure thesis or not, it's clear his intent is not to put people down, but to build them up.

But there are too many people involved in the Trump campaign who have a serious medical or psychological malady where, the instant they're through talking to an influential Russian, they forget all about it.
Lastly, I've seen very little comment on Trump, jr saying, in his e-mail, he was promised a meeting with the Russian crown prosecutor. That didn't scream ""scam""? That didn't shout ""I'm the president of Nigeria and I need your bank account to store $100 million""?
Russia doesn't HAVE a crown prosecutor's office. If anything, it has a federal prosecutor's office. Russia -- in theory -- is a republic. The last ruler of Russia to have a crown prosecutor was brutally murdered along with his family, and then made a saint 80 or so years later. Putin may want to be tsar, but he isn't one yet."

Though, this topic was not about a CBC comedy series... this is a serious issue for both sides, but then that is another Canadian perspective.

Further, there seems, as well, to be much larger issues which are at play globally concerning this religion; it seems to have a number of jihadist terror organizations that are associated with it -- that right there could be the poisonous fly in the ointment ; clearer communication from all facets of the Muslim World needs to be spoken to that reality, including an explanatory resonance of reason concerning of this non-integration with 'Infidels and Jews'..

There are a number of issues that are 'fluffed-off' which is a darn good reason why 'martyrdom' is not what is needed here by Islam -- a good solid sit-down integrated respectful discussion with all the players is.. both Male & Female.. with or without the religious sartorial."

2) All of these rebels are already closely aligned to Alqueda and ISIS, including the FSA, where they are seen on camera calling them their brothers
3)The gulf states have the same ideology as ISIS and Alqueda. These are your 'sunnis' that you are protecting. Hillary has already admitted that we know KSA and Qatar fund ISIS in the region.  You support these sunnis, but in Syira, and Iran anyone is free to practice their religion.  How many churches are in KSA? Thats right, 0

I find it strange that Trump is obsessed with healthcare rather than infrastructure. Given his background in real estate, it is a shame that he has failed to make his mark on infrastructure. Infrastructure could actually lead to a higher GDP. Overall, Trump has been a disappointment as President. I give him poor marks for being lazy and for his inability to form a productive relationship with Congress. Trump is practically a lame duck. I suspect he will be forgotten in history."

Spicer didn't lie to press corps, they were the liars and lied again all day today (and Doyle swallowed it all). Spicer was asked to remain as Press Secretary by Scaramucci but resigned, having been passed over for Comms Director job. He would be far better returning to his old job as GOP congressional comms director, but can make much more money going forward as a corporate comms director or a talking head on TV.

They always say the woman they are cheating on is ""crazy,"" or something like that.

My advice is, do not ask him to clear up a confusion he has created.  If he is not being honest about the situation, he will only be dishonest again.  Figure it out for yourself.

Most people who have actually gotten away from a ""crazy"" ex do not encourage the crazies by keeping a facebook page or anything else showing a continuing relationship, especially if they have concerns.

You need to acquaint yourself with autos da fe in Middle Ages Europe. Christians did precisely that to women accused of witchcraft, Jews who refused to convert, Christians who were accused of heresy (that is, they held beliefs the authorities didn't approve of), and others. After some Jews rejected Martin Luther's protestant Christianity as not being their cup of tea, Martin Luther suggested locking Jews in synagogues and setting the synagogues on fire.
If that's too ancient for you, only 30 years ago, Christians were raping and slaughtering Muslims in the former country of Yugoslavia.
Last year, Jews living in the West Bank burned down Arabs' houses and mosques, and in at least one house, the occupants were in it.
Terrorists are brutal. A lot of terrorists are Muslim. That does NOT make all Muslims dogs.
If a man from Arvada gets angry at his ex-wife and burns down her home with her in it, are all Arvadans to be considered dogs?"

Trump's attempts to obstruct, now that the investigation follows the money, appears suspicious. If he's innocent, seems he would support an investigation to clear his name, and he likely wouldn't inquire about pardons for his aides, his family, and himself.

Kushner's testimony was ridiculous. Trump's senior advisor didn't even know the name of the attending Russian ambassador? And he didn't know the subject of the meeting, when the subject line clearly indicated its purpose? Why didn't Kushner disclose his contacts on his security clearance forms - his assistant's fault?

2) Nearly all cyclists also have vehicles, so they pay the same taxes as everyone else. Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.

3) Colorado's image as an outdoor recreation Mecca, which includes being a cycling friendly state, is a huge economic draw. It's one of the reasons we won the outdoor retailer show away from Utah. Your idiotic proposal is counter-productive to the development of Colorado's outdoor-based economy.

You said that you were critical of Trump because he isn't doing what he said he'd do fast enough.  There's word going around that part of this decision is to take those measly dollars spent on care for trans folks and divert towards funding for the border wall.  Weren't we told over and over that Mexico was going to pay for the wall?

Ever wonder why despite Trump's rhetoric about ""locking her up"", he decided after the election to move on from prosecuting Hillary?  Have you ever wondered why we're back to Hillary again?

Towards the end of the day we're sitting at our campsite and watch some guy on a quad go off the trail and go tearing through an untouched meadow. 4 of us went running down the hill to yell at him about it. The obligatory answer of ""Sorry"" came back. You could tell he didn't care, he just got caught. Earlier in the day we'd cleaned up a shooting area of 400+ spent shells and casings that people left behind before we got our own gear out. It's BS like this that ruin it for everyone.

And some, not just transgender people, join for the  medical care.

I knew a family (because our daughter had cancer) who joined the military so that their son (who was already diagnosed with cancer, could have the best medical care.  So what you and your MAGAphant lapdogs are saying is that you'd like to decide who, and for what treatments, should be covered by medical insurance.

Trump has no grasp of healthcare policy and was completely useless during the Republican healthcare debacle. His incoherent, rambling  and self-contradictory sound bites about healthcare exposed him as intellectually lazy and willfully ignorant. At critical times, he was watching television, playing golf, attending a parade in Paris, or fueling territorial battles between members of his incompetent staff.

Guns are iconic to the point of being talesmanic for that White working class the article says were crucial.    Clinton declared war on guns, calling out the NRA by name, boasting that this was going to be the year they beat them.     She, and the Democrats generally,  just didn't get it.  They called it wrong. 

How could they have been so stupid?  Couldn't they have seen from the runaway NICS background check data that guns were not to be messed with?     The answer explains how and  why they lost.   Having given themselves up to the shameful lusts of the minority fringes, they wanted to be fooled.

The fact is that other than Jokic, and perhaps even with him, the Nuggets have nothing to offer that would interest the Cavaliers. Over at the Pepsi Center they have delusional ideas about the value of their roster, which is why the ""brain trust"" has failed year after year to make useful trades. Chandler had some value last year when he could have been offered with two years left on a reasonable contract. Now he is a guy who will be a free agent in nine months and will be looking for a fat contract. Murray is a second year player who looked OK, but shot 40%. The Nugs have destroyed any value Mudiay might have had. Harris is a player who has improved his first three years, but will be a free agent in a year - at a position where there is a glut of talent around the league.

He is used to get anything he wants by subduing his opponents, and he is discovering the hard way that his methods do not work when it comes to international politics. He does not understand that a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of vinegar, so he goes out of control and tweets his anger whenever things don't go his way. His childish attitude is a clear advantage for his opponents, who will often use it to get under his skin. I expect the sales of his book ""The art of the deal"" to plummet, for a negotiator who cannot control his emotions is doomed to fail."

She's not ""honorable"" because defense of racists is not honorable but unseemly, undemocratic and grotesque. I'd be interested to know what part of Trumpian policy you agree with. I'm sure the Republican agenda, which is primarily racist, will make great headway in 3 years. Trump has already normalized racism in front of thousands of boy scouts. All the world is observing Americans and how they are normalizing racism, violent sexism and homophobia. When they think of Americans they now think of Donald Trump--a liar, sex abuser, cheat, and a disgusting lout. Donald Trump, king of the Americans."

Then require that the families be mixed. By that, I mean, that GOP and Dems MUST be mixed up and not segregated. 
This way, I would expect occasional block parties, etc, with kids and parents meeting each other and perhaps the CONgress critters will be talking.

And if flattening the country isn't an option then why the heck isn't the rest of the world simply cutting them off completely? Nevermind that silly $1 billion in sanctions - cut them off from everything. Zero imports and zero exports. Same goes for the people - no one gets in and no one gets out.

And honestly, if someone is going to be that badly affected by reading those four little letters, they're better off not reading Poplak's articles anyway, as he tends to deal with topics that are far heavier than one silly little swear word.

Or to put it another way, as Stephen Fry said: ""If my words offend you, well so fucking what?"""

5746356,The real threat to your future lifestyle is the growing debt combined with incomes and the work force growing more and more slowly. At some point the chickens will come home to roost and that money will have to be paid back (or the debt servicing will just result in higher and higher taxes).  Think of that next time you voice your support for more government giveaways - there no such thing as a free lunch.  And there aren't enough rich people that you can tax to pay for it.  It will eventually come out of your (and your children's) bank accounts.  Despite what idiots like Krugman think.

5747756,My mom owned five duplexes in Juneau back in the 80's and 90's. She finally sold all of them because of exactly this problem. She tried to get better renters by simply pricing the low-lifes out by doubling the price of the rental. Always the same. She made her decision to quit the biz when she opened a door to a bedroom to find it packed with garbage bags to the ceiling. The dumpster was just down the street. Renter too lazy to walk there. She had to have the room gutted down to the floor joists and rebuilt. Pigs. Human pigs.

Unless we have 0.00 as the only acceptable Blood Alcohol Content, then we must by definition, establish a BAC level beyond which one is considered impaired.  Which means in the converse, below that limit, one is not considered impaired.  It must be set at some level.  

There is no basis upon which to justify a change to 0.05 from 0.08 as being that ideal limit.  This is completely a political decision, not borne of research, science or evidence.

Poor white Americans were used to chase escaped slaves they themselves could never afford. Poor white Americans were used to segregate and terrorize freedmen who only wanted liberty. Poor white Americans were used to enforce Jim Crow the 20th century.

Of course, it would have been a huge deal - and an excellent example of how to deal with a lecherous, hands-y sexist pig.  Instead, she smiled and let the incident pass.

I'm just saying: if you're a shop girl working for minimum wage the courts are not a realistic option.  A slap to the face of the perpetrator, on the other hand, is free and, in the moment at least, a visceral and satisfying bit of justice."

According to your logic I am racist and anti-Semitic against myself and family. Do you see how ignorant your comment is now? Probably not because you don't deal in reality, only wishful thinking and willful ignorance of said reality."
5793225,"Since the trolls have shown up and are are accusing everyone they disagree with of being Nazi sympathizers, while copy/pasting their comments, I'll do the same with my response.

Now this is hilarious. When you have no argument and the facts aren't on your side ad hominem attacks are what you use. BTW, facts aren't racist or bigoted. Try to ease up on your obvious biases and maybe you'll open your eyes to the truth.
The following is what makes your comment beyond hilarious. I am from a multi-racial family. We are black, white, Mexican, Jewish, et al. To top all of that off I had a family member murdered by the KKK decades ago, so unlike you, I actually have valid reasons to hate racists and Nazis.
People like you just throw out personal attacks, while having no clue about anything. Pathetic.

P.S. My name is a combination of matter (as in forms of it based in science) and AK as in Alaska...you know, the state I'm in.

So much fail from the trolls"

Most of what we now about sexuality comes from a report by Charles Kensington who was a sexual sadist, pedophile and all round pervert. He sold the courts on a bill of malarkey that pedophiles should get lighter sentences and be allowed back out. I will agree that there are degrees of offenses and that some should get a second chance. But that's why we have judges to make that decision."

And, of course, the moral of the story is twofold...voters are dumb and DON'T YOU DARE VOTE REPUBLICAN!!! Apparently both Westneat and this reporter think they're clever or something which simply is not the case.Both reporters glide past the fact that, in Washington state, it made not a whit of difference how Grays Harbor voted because Trump was never gonna win the state anyways.  They may have voted for Trump but they certainly didn't elect him.Even better, they also make no mention of the fact Grays Harbor has been miserable for decades, including the last eight years of Saint Obama.

True, the segregationists in Congress and Southern state government were Democrats out of tradition, but they were called ""Dixiecrats"" to distinguish them from progressive Northern Democrats in the FDR mold. Lyndon Johnson was a Texas Dixiecrat and known bigot who nevertheless nurtured and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which killed Jim Crow, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which largely ended black voter disenfranchisement, primarily in the South. After 1964 and particularly after Lee Atwater's Southern Strategy got Reagan elected, Dixiecrats switched their party loyalty to Republican. Today their are very few Democrats in Southern state government.

There can be no doubt now."
5797900,You sound like a total moron. Bravo
5797907,"Complete rubbish.

Slavery was a part of the Confederacy just as it was part of the Union.  Lincoln stated clearly that he would rather have slavery and keep the Union, than have manumission and not keep the Union.

You lend new meaning to the concept of ""ignorant arrogance.""  Lee's will freed his slaves and he was against the institution of slavery.

Whipping was a common punishment at the time.  Freemen as well as slaves were frequently whipped.  Andrew Johnson was frequently whipped as a young man for his misdeeds.

When the Army of Northern Virginia invaded PA, they did not rape, steal, vandalize, and murder civilians as the Yank armies did throughout the South.  Their civility was due to Southern commanders like General Lee.

You are the sort of alt-left progressive who is going to start Civil War II because you want to impose politically-correct standards of 2017 on those who lived 155 years ago and you want to change facts to fit your political agenda.

5800140,"Trump doesn't want to be a dictator...he is a dictator.  He has a legislative branch with his own party holding a majority; that does not want to ever reign in this person's megalomania.  He foments the innate fears of middle America - racism, economic and social prejudices, and lays blame at the steps of anyone who speaks out or stands against him.  For those saying that its refreshing that he is saying what's on his mind, that's like saying Hitler was great because he made it clear exactly what his final solution was to the ""Jewish Problem"".  The sad part?  Someone like Trump from his social background, has little love for the average white male that espouses Trump's platform and racially charged diatribes."

At worst, you are a Nazi.
If you stood and chanted with men and women who wore hoods emblazoned with confederate flags you are a KKK sympathizer.
If you stand up for these people's good intentions and walk in solidarity with their ""defense of cultural heritage"" you are at least a fellow traveler in white supremacy, more likely a white supremacist yourself.

Not ALL lives matter, not Arab lives matter, not muslim lives matter,   not transgender or homosexual lives matter.  Just BLACK lives matter.  There is also offense taken if you insist on ALL lives matter.   Tell me again about racism.   Blacks can exclude whites or any other group from their gatherings, but let whites try to exclude blacks from a gathering and cries of racism  ring out from coast to coast.  Tell me again about racism.  Blacks can riot and yell racist chants, but nary a word is said.  Let all blacks be nominated for an award and it is cheered as diversity, let the same group nominate all whites and it is racist.

The democrats stopped acting gracious and that caused decorum to go out the window everywhere. 
Why is it that the only time we have unrest in Canada and the United States is after the liberals lose?  
They should let Trump do what he promised but they can't or won't let that happen so he just operates as a lame duck president and this insanity will continue until they get their way.

This is not Canada ...with a bunch of ¬´ Loyalists ¬ª Orangemen.  
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada.
After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Qu√©bec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Qu√©bec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.‚Ä¶

If there are any remaining racists in the Democratic Party, the members will marginalize and push them out.

The Democratic Party of the 1800s, though, was the conservative party. They were not ""leftist"" at all.

Entitlements are not ""slavery."" That's just a silly remark, pre-packaged propaganda to demonize people who need help. Look at Ben Carson -- on public assistance and loans and public housing all his life until he made it on his own, and now he demonizes welfare. Bunch of hypocrites."

5830299,"- Stupidest statement I've read in a while:  ""When we bike, we have as much right to the road as when we drive,"" said Vicki Harper, spokeswoman for State Farm.
- Then answers why: ""Unfortunately, when bikes and cars collide, cyclists are much more susceptible to serious injury or death.""
- Pedestrians usually, if not always, have the ""right of way""... and again ""unfortunately"", regardless of human indignation and on-paper 'rights', the human body can't compete with speeds/weight of a ton or two of glass and metal, fiberglass, and plastic... nor distracted drivers ...period.
Motorcycles are better equipped to compete with speeds, and there's token effort to equip riders with protective gear. Bicyclists are at much more disadvantage and often required to use bikepaths when they are present.

They let these people in to cause division among the citizens, they want racial violence so they can lock us all down with martial law. Once the parasites get their martial law they will ramp up the immigration genocide to ethnically cleanse white people in short order. The globalist parasites are vile haters that are working day and night since the end of WW2 to bring down western society and ethnically cleanse white people.

What about roads that have rumble bars on the shoulders, so you have to ride in the (only, non-passing) lane?  I've seen them all over the country.  Also, your claim about  roads being designed before ""bikes were so prevalent"" means what, exactly???  Do you realize there were bicycles for decades before cars?

Just how much discrimination in college admissions, violent crime against whites by blacks, and being beaten over the head with the notion that ""whiteness is a great evil"" are whites supposed to take?  There are professors that are calling for white genocide and uttering anti-white sentiments.  

White liberals can certainly be called out for their hypocrisy in supporting minorities yet refusing to live among them or send their kids to diverse schools.  The reality is that they refuse to admit why they don't do that - it's because too many low performing minorities drag down a school and whites simply don't want their children bullied or beaten up."

Let 'em.  Just make clear that if they do, and if they get detained, they're on their own.  Why expend resources on either side of the issue?  ""Banning"" implicates the expenditure of resources to prevent.  Just as ""rescuing"", or negotiating returns, or making diplomatic efforts is resource expenditure.

BOTH China and Russia are publicly, and directly opposing the US on NK.  The rest of the world is silent in the face of that opposition.  Trump opened the door WIDE to that.

The shift is remarkable, dangerous, and a HUGE step backwards.

And, you could see it coming.  Trump totally misread, bumbled and overplayed his hand with NK.  He's taught countries with potential for nuclear technology that they can develop it wtihout being concerned about US military intervention.  It's a breathtaking diminution of US power, regard and deterrent force.

The discussion is no longer about the prospect of disarming NK nuclearly.  It is about China and Russia telling the US it cannot use military action upon NK.  

Trump has solidified NK as a presumptive nuclear power.  Maybe others' too.

You're nothing but a bunch of deadbeat, paranoid, white supremacists, who feel it is their 'moral obligation' to keep their society '20 Mule Team white'. 

The fact that the government of the US allows the continued public display of some kind of weirdo statue (likely erected in the. middle of the night by a bunch of drunken yahoos in white hoods), that calls for the outright murder of 7 Billion people, tells you all you need to know about the 'American mentality'."

Trump is being nice by giving Pelosi the idiot and the rest of  congressional members to write a law.  Given the incompetence of this congress don't hold your breath.

BTW, one way out would be to give them legal residence but no path ever to citizenship for them or their children and/or other relatives.  Also, end the legal right of citizenship for anyone born in America"

You're a vain and feigned Christian, Harry.

The truth is, there is no justification in supposing that the Jewish community needs to speak out simply because Zille is Jewish. After all, she did not speak as a Jew. Hode's contention is that Jews somehow deserved Mnxgitama‚Äôs racist tweet. That contention is in itself racist, and absurd."

Of course this is what the libtard left wants...for a few elites to tell the rest of us what we need, what we will have, and what we can do. If I wanted to live in an oppressive form of society, I'd move to North Korea. If that's what you progressives want, maybe you folks should move to North Korea."

The case for or against DACA isn‚Äôt really a constitutional case at all. It is a question of whether federal laws enacted by Congress permitted the Obama administration to act as it did.

You completely miss the point, which is: why is it acceptable for Trump to waive immigration laws and create immigration laws out of thin air, as he has with Executive Order 13769, but unacceptable for Obama to create DACA? The Republicans are talking out of both sides of their mouths. Using the ignorant pejorative term ""anchor baby"" pretty well sums up your inability to understand the gross hypocrisy in the Trump/(some) Republicans' stance on DACA. DACA is a humane policy; Executive Order 13769 is a racist, bigoted policy."
5903048,"Forget the racist crap, unlawful immigration knows no race. Any race here unlawfully needs to have deportation proceedings initiated per Title 8 of the U.S. Code section 1225(b)(2)(A)
It reads:
""‚Äúif the examining immigration officer determines that an alien seeking admission is not clearly and beyond a doubt entitled to be admitted, the alien shall be detained for a [removal] proceeding under section 1229a of this title""

Even Obama admitted that his Executive Order on DACA was unConstitutional / illegal, but you don't want to hear anything against your Lord and personal savior, Barack Obama.

Racist in Chief is just trying to eliminate anything Obama had passed, period.  What a loser!

He's building a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it. Another lie!!! He wants us tax payers to pay for it & says he'll get Mexico to reimburse us? Huh? By adding a tax that we'll pay when buying goods from Mexico? We're going to pay for it twice?  And he makes his crappy clothes in Mexico? America First huh?

He then claims that unemployment is down to a 16 year low but the DACA program is taking away jobs?  Huh? What an idiot!  If DACA recipients were blonde haired Swedish girls he wouldn't have reversed this.  TRUE FACT!

Experience shows it actually makes the issues that do exist worse (look at Alabama or Arizona). We need a combination of better border security and a way to solve the issue of the 11 million already here.

After several years in Denali (where I met my now wife) we settled in Fairbanks for better job prospects. Initially I wasn't sure about the place but as I came to learn the extensive trail system the mountain biker in me went nuts. I also found plenty of things to get involved in because Fairbanks residents have to create their own good times. People here are doers. When you meet someone questions don't revolve around jobs, we ask where have you hiked/biked/hunted/fished/climbed/etc. In other words, how have you taken advantage of this place and what it offers? You can go to a party and find a millionaire swapping trail tales with a plumber and they've known each other for years and you can't tell which is which from the looks of them.

I have seen Asians being nasty to Asians, Asians saying nasty things to Asians, Asians saying nasty things about Asians.

Asians are easy targets for racists & bullies because Asians are less likely to beat you up or talk back to you if you harass them.

Try - the Dems playing Trump for a sucker to get him to push THEIR legislation - and in the process giving them enormously more power in congress than they had 2 weeks ago - and the ability to seriously impede the republican agenda going forward. 

Right now there is a toddler in the white house. The republican party thought they could control him - and keep the tantrums in check and get him to rubber stamp their plans... their devil's bargain has not payed off well.
In the meantime - the democrats figured out that you don't NEED to try and control a toddler - you just fool him and play him for a sucker. Nice work there.

But if you thought Trump was clearing the swamp - how did you miss that he hasn't even tried ? Hell he stuffed his cabinet with ex-Goldman-Sachs bankers, there is literally nobody MORE swampy than that in the world ! 
It's the most elitest (and wealthiest) cabinet in history, even after all that turn-over."
5933101,"RE: your last line, Layla4.  Opinions are just that. Publishing them without any ""verification"" of the facts, gives the likes of you and I the opportunity to step forward and say, ""Hey, wait a minute!"" and expose the idiocy. So, a great service, no?

Speaking of idiocy...I found this amusing: The former editor says, ""Social media has let loose all kinds of dark instincts that were lurking. When you thought it was just your own dark thoughts, and there was nobody who shared them, maybe you wouldn't have been so loud about them. But when you find there are a whole bunch of people who agree, it does give you volume.""

Social media doesn't care about the type of thoughts or instincts. Neither does MSM. It disseminates EVERYTHING, ""dark"" or ""light.""  And without social media, who would read/see/hear feminists' thoughts?  Well, there'd be ""nobody who shared them,"" and nobody'd know that ""there are a whole bunch of people who agree.""

She is no example for others as she cares for nobody but herself.  She may have those that admire her, but my guess is they are likely cut from the same cloth.  There is nothing good to say about this woman except  that she lost her 2nd Presidential election even after cheating to become the Democrat candidate.

5955991,"""loose talk""????

I'll have you know, NP5491, that I chose those words very, very carefully. 

I watched, I thought about it, and I came to the conclusion that Trump is an idiot.

Just because well foundationed, rational and justifiable description doesn't fit into your fantasies of a world actually ruled by Trump, doesn't mean they aren't well foundationed, rational and justifiable.

One defintion of idiot in the Merriam-Webster Dictionary is:

""a foolish or stupid person""

So, relative to firing Comey, Trump was both stupid and foolish.  Evidence?  Mueller, Bannon and general ongoing controversy.

Relative to new smear campaign against Comey?  Stupid and foolish.  The talkiing points miss the pint, but more importantly, they re-raise how stupid and foolish he was to fire Comey in the first place.  Lester Holt's interview gets more views on Youtube.

Plus, just overall, he's stupid and foolish.  So, idiot.  And, also idiotic.  For his idiotness (A word?  You can criticize if not)."

Don't we all have bills to pay , children to educate and concerns about our economic future ?

Do we actually see the RRSP and TFSA limits as adequate to the task ?

THEN, Cassidy CO-SPONSORS/CO-INTRODUCES, then advocates for, a bill that simply does not do what he promised.

No straw man.  KEY man.  NON-CREDIBLE man.  And clearly, not a man of integrity or principle.

Do what Cassidy did (exploit and lie), and you get it from those you exploit and lie to.

Prior to that, Rev. Gerald Fitzgerald had submitted a report to Pius XII:

http://www.awrsipe.com/Doyle/2011/2011-01-11--paraclete_report.htm

Highlight:

In 1950 Fr. Gerald wrote to Bishop Buddy of San Diego and told him that for the first time in the community's three year history the main monastery, known as Via Coeli (Way to Heaven) was filled to capacity and had to turn a priest away. He went on to state that at that time there were priests from 35 U.S. dioceses and 9 religious communities at Via Coeli.   
Fr. Gerald had a very negative opinion of priests who sexually abused minors. In the 1950's he wrote to a number of bishops asking if they had an island in their dioceses where he could establish a totally isolated facility to permanently house such priests."

 To further address your ignorance; before every hire in my lifetime, I negotiated my own wages, and benefits just fine. Furthermore, my Chickasaw mother, ran the medical offices of Reynolds Metals, and the Port of Portland, both of which are union. My mother was non-union, and managed to negotiate better wages, and benefits than the union workers she took care of when they injured themselves on the job. The only people I know who need a union to attain better wages are slackers who let people like me carry their load.

The idiot Democrats also forgot to pass the law guaranteeing payment for insurance company losses.  This billion dollar subsidy is what congress has been doing illegally since the passage of the ACA.  The Republicans want to stop these illegal payments.

6007479,"Unbelievable! 
Boilers routinely catch fire, disrupting class time and causing students to miss valuable learning time.
Temperatures of classrooms are either too hot or too cold. 
Classroom space too small for the number of students. 
No room for students to sit at a desk comfortably.
Sinking foundations are critical concerns. 
Old roof-drainage system causing brick columns to deteriorate in the school‚Äôs walkway.
44 kindergarten students in one classroom because there is no extra room.
Campbell said the bond measure will not increase the amount of property taxes collected by the district.
I myself do not have children in school but I don‚Äôt like to live with stupid people, I‚Äôd much rather they get an education.
Susan Honda wants to be our mayor yet she doesn‚Äôt think we should fix these problems?? Oh, but she is concerned about the school her daughters attended."
6007505,"Actually, don't get over it.  You're right.  I hope you MAGAphants keep hoping that Hillary has committed a crime, while Mueller tightens the noose on the baby-in-chief's friend's, family, and staff.  It's going to be fun watching you idiots screaming ""lock her up"", long after all the Trumpites are indicted.  It really will be fun, fun, fun"
6007527,"Fact #1 In 2016 the NFL ratings were the lowest in decades, costing the team owners many millions of dollars.

Fact #2 A Rasmussen poll found 32% of adults are less likely to watch games due the Kaepernick-led player protests.

Fact #1 plus Fact #2 equals fire the idiots who bite the hands that made them millionaires."
6007718,"So sad to see the Examiner make crap up since they have no story. I hope you have placed your name at the head of the ""fake news"" list since you're the biggest hypocrite. Goodbye Washington Examiner."
6007819,"Rick:  I just posted numerous questions about YOU and YOUR sister, and YOU Flagged them.  So, YOU are a LIAR about the open book."
6007897,"Trump is such an idiot.  When the President speaks like this, he's massively escalating the issue to implicate the 1st Amendment.  Now, I wonder if every NFL team kneels for the National Anthem tomorrow - not in protest of ""social injustice"" or ""police brutality"" or some such tripe, but in support of the 1st Amendment!  And, as a constitutional conservative, I would likely support such NFL players kneeling in protest."
6007900,"So, in your twisted brain, Trump winning the presidency caused two hurricanes?

So then, genius, what caused all of the natural disasters before November 8, 2016?

You are hilarious!  Thank you so much for the free laughs."
6007917,HAAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHHAH and more AHAHAHHAHAHAH.  Sensitive?  The truth always hurts...another greenhorn attorney.  Proof? Read the fools response.  And more HAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAAH!
6007952,"If I had a dog that acted like Donald Trump, I'd shoot it in the head."
6007974,"This is how silly our ""patriots"" are. Not many of them even know the name of our national anthem that they are holding up as sacred. Well, do you?"
6008052,The malignant narcissist and mentally deranged sociopath opens his foul mouth and nothing comes out but excrement. He continues to further demean the office of president with his ceaseless insults and stupidity. The disgusting buffoon doesn't know it's better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a moron than open it and proven one.
6008256,You are no conservative. Just plain 'ol white trash.
6009019,The problem is that you are a lying sack and whatever you say is just lies. You are probably a scum immigration attorney.
6009059,Now you're just thrashing. Next you'll stamp your foot and hold your breath 'til you turn blue.
6009115,...another idiot quoting idiots in history. You made the day.
6009139,Pussies
6009211,"WE THE PEOPLE are sick and tired of coddling these pathetic overpaid athletes!
Someone had to be the grown-up in the room, and tell you the truth! You don't like standing for the anthem? I don't care! You stand, remain silent if you wish, show respect (look the word up) and play ball, or get the ffffffffffffffk off the field and OUT of MY country! You don't like America............LEAVE MFKR!!!"
6009367,Lebrun James is disgusting! I used to like him but he stumped for HRC the biggest most corrupt politician to EVER run and called blacks SUPER OREDATORS and he trashes Trump?? I quit watching NBA because of him and the Seattle Seahawks version of the NBA-GS Warriors! They're friggn racists and I'm DONE! Only college football for me until......let's unite and boycott the NFL/NBA!!! ESPN is dying too thank the lord.....RACIST LIBTARDS
6009414,"These ""athletes"" (more like pu$$ies) can't take a few words from Tump. Poor little tulips..."
6009470,"Flagged potty mouth, Go Trump!"
6009537,"SO MUCH WINNING BY NIKKI HALEY - she's going to make a great first woman president (sorry Hillary but no one likes you but everyone likes Nikki Haley, plus she's way better looking and not a lesbian :o"
6009744,"""molesting his own daughter and betraying America to Russia""
The first part of that sentence makes you a disgusting liar. The second part makes you galactically stupid."
6009947,"Got a link for that, troll?

Or, is this just another one of your lies, troll?"
6010030,"It's so weird to have an actual stupid narcissistic childish person in the white house. GW Bush wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, but at least he was moral and had a conscience. This guy is certified. I haven't seen anything like this in my lifetime. What were the people who voted for him thinking?"
6010133,I am sick of racist blacks. Boycott pro sports!!
6010159,"Trump the draft-dodger, p-grabber 
let stupidity ring"
6010240,"NAACP - I've noticed a trend, it's only black players who are disrespecting the US flag and kneeling during the national anthem."
6010324,You are a racist imbecile.  Just in case you didn't already know that.
6010407,Naacp is a racist hate group they are they are scum terrorists just like Isis and the Taliban
6010678,"what I know about you is that you are profoundly ignorant, uneducated, incapable of an intelligent discussion, and are going on the mute list as you are a complete waste of my time."
6010808,An elected fool is still a fool. Not sure why folks think they will suddenly become capable in office.
6010846,Who the hell cares?  Just another team to turn off.  Idiots.
6010914,dumpy should keep his big mouth shut.  everytime he says something he puts his foot in his mouth.  he is an idiot.
6011041,Now I'll stop watching MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL...bunch of rich cry babies who only play a child's game...try putting on a different uniform...join the military and then you'll maybe understand what the flag represents...asshole
6011066,Damned breeders.  Not a thought above the waist.
6011111,"Trump speaks for fewer and fewer people every day.  Unfortunately for the United States, Mr. Trump is an imbecile who has proven that he's unable to govern.  His administration is a failed, hot mess."
6011117,"I seriously doubt that the football coach had anything remotely to do with it.

Football coaches don't control the idiots in the stands."
6011121,Pretty sad to see the entire school and football team and school district being typecast based on the actions of a few morons
6011311,Filthy niggers.
6011407,It doesn't get any dumber and more ignorant than your scribble.
6011693,"Raising a flag is not inciting a riot...stupid yes, illegal...no."
6011765,Dump is a piece of national trash. No wonder the vast majority of the country hates that failing idiot. He's a joke and a laughingstock. Mueller must have found some more evidence and he's trying to change the dialogue...
6011838,"What are you going to do, kick God's ass?"
6011880,That move to sucede from Colorado had to do with ranchers fighting over water rights. About 20 years ago another group west of the tunnel wanted to become part of Utah over water rights. No one wants to sucede over a stupid flag at a football game.
6011899,"""What are you going to do, kick God's ass?""
Easily done when the opponent is a figment of imagination, no?"
6011968,"Didn't bother to read the article, did you? That kind of laziness does allow you to identify yourself as a fool."
6012081,"Excellent article, excellent action.

One comment re the headline however: I am sick unto death of the milk-soppy phrase ""domestic abuse"". WTH is that anyway? I know how it arose, I've been around that long--it was an attempt to get away from the heterosexist ""wife beating"" label.

But ""domestic abuse"" is idiotic--and misleading, and a misrepresentation. It is not domesticity that is being abused, nor is it ""domestics"".

It's assault within a partner relationship--and even that's a bit slippery: typically, it's woman-battering.

If we can't name it more precisely, we are never going to be able to change it.

All that said, again: excellent article, excellent action."
6012188,"They would also have to buy back roads bridges and other infrastructure from the state. UNC, owned by the State etc. ... And what happens when the boom busts? Weld county revenues rely heavily on oil and gas production. What happens next time the market drops? The boom busts. Then Weld comes back to Colorado with their tail between their legs. 
Weld County is lucky to part of one of the best states in the country. Even though there are some backward hicks, cooler heads prevail. Sorry, clown."
6012279,"Fact is. You don't neglect the house you live in because you hate the landlord, otherwise you only live in the misery yourself. Respect your country, stand for the anthem, respect the flag .. it all symbolizes the land that allows you this freedom. Patriotism isn't decided by who the current Leader is, don't be a fool. STAND UP AND RESPECT"
6012281,"Annihilate means kill them all, not carpet bomb, bozo."
6012501,Leave it to the tinfoil hat wearers to waste tax payers money on this stupid lawsuit!
6012540,What a ridiculous statement
6012579,"This is what they chant when protesting, how do you read this.
Black Lives Matter Protesters Chant 'Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon!' KILL THE COPS!

Are you calling ""cops"" fascist thugs?"
6012831,"And it's ok for the NFL idiots to raise their fists for ""black power"".  Why don't these CTE work hole filled brains donate their money to build housing and get their brothers out of the ghettos.  Oh, they won't do that......overpaid idiots."
6012857,"""Trump is stupid and reckless.""

More true words were never spoken."
6012901,There's no law against being crude and stupid.
6012955,"Can't defend the dotard, must attack someone else. Well, at least you grouped him with similar hateful tyrants."
6013071,And Chump should keep his ridiculous self centered comments to himself!!!
6013094,"Huh.  Look at that.  Across the nation, in dozens of stadiums, players, coaches and owners knelt, raised fists, put hands on shoulders, and nothing happened.  No one walked out, no one was fired, and the sky didn't even fall.  Trump has never shown himself to be more irrelevant than he has with his childish tirade."
6013157,"Hope these demonstrations of team solidarity make an impression on the hapless, hopeless, mentally deranged moron in the White House. He couldn't keep a job wrapping burgers at McDucks. How much longer do we have to tolerate this excrement-spouting malignant narcissist and bellicose sociopath? What a repugnant, disgusting example of a presidential wannabe."
6013189,"As the far-left crazies kneel for the anthem.  Yeah, its the GOP that is anti-American. Talk about a dotard.  Definition of it dude."
6013190,"Trump doesn't understand most, or even any of the actual issues, and he's too lazy to be bothered. That's why he brays like a jack@$$ at his rallies and with twitter. It distracts his often as-ignorant base."
6013209,Poor Thierry needs a tissue for his tears!  Eurotrash whining is so adorable!
6013251,NFL payers that that kneel during the National Anthem should be classified as enemies of the country. The ignorant bastards should go to another country and try to make the money they make in the USA.
6013265,"True but the president is supposed to lead, not follow.  What a failed presidency.  No leadership whatsoever.  Even GW was better than this clown."
6013446,Arpaio is as much of a horse's -as as the moron who pardoned him.
6013562,"My comment is, did you ALSO comment on the inflammation of race relations caused by Obama, Holder and Lynch?  If not and you are only commenting about Trump, using the BLM standards, you must be racist since you did not publically criticize an African-American but you criticize an Anglo-American. It used to be it was simply called being a hypocrite, but since using BLM has determined that if you treat someone different (albeit the real reason is based on their opinion and not race) if the subjects are of a different race, then your criticism must be based on your own inherent racism."
6013625,"I wouldn't sell  Ukraine a damn thing until they resolve their Anti-Terrorist Operation in the Donbass.   Instead of arming them Trudeau should be telling them to start negotiating a peaceful settlement like they should have done instead of unleashing the armed forces and fascist militias.   Remind ""Peace President"" Poroshenko he signed the Minsk agreement and hasn't done a thing about effecting it."
6013912,"Tomlin is full of crap.
If you can't even show up for the flag and anthem, you are participating in the politics.
Only one guy on the team with guts."
6014096,"Adam Schiff is another dotard like John McCain I wish I could take a pill for and never see or hear him again.  It's like he's on a quest in life to some how, one day prove that Trump colluded with Russia."
6014101,You can't fix stupid
6014133,"Remember when the adults were in the WH and when most Americans were proud of the POTUS that held the office? Less than a year ago?



This stupid clown is such a skidmark on the office."
6014142,"Trump's an immature fool, but don't rationalize the protest. It's a disrespectful, classless act that should end."
6014346,Arpaio is as much of a horse's --- as the demented sociopath in the WH who pardoned him.
6014351,"I'm sorry. There are many hateful people. I hope your faith can help you overcome these awful people. They will never leave, but we must be stronger."
6014587,don't be so damn naive.
6014607,"Three questions:  

To McCoy:  Any particular reason you abandoned the run?  CJ had more than 20 carries in the first 2 games.  Offense clicking on all cylinders.  So...let's mix it up and only give him 8! Do you understand why this was a bad idea?

To Joseph:  That idiot call on the fake punt with a rookie in his first appearance was pointless and grandstanding.  The booth guys called it gutsy, but they are stupid. Don't do that again.  

To Elway:  Are you beginning to understand why trading TJ was a bad idea?  Every time I saw Parks and Simmons in coverage, they looked like scarecrows in a windstorm.  Meanwhile, PFF placed TJ on their roster of the week last week. 

Oh!  One more.  To the refs:  Why did you want Buffalo to win so badly?"
6014691,And he has chosen a sport that is overwhelmingly African American.  How dumb can you get.
6014797,"It seems that unless someone agrees with your opinion or policy they are wrong, a coward or a fool. Are you suggesting all the athletes that choose to stand during the national anthems are wrong as well?"
6014831,What the f are you talking about?  Is this sarcasm?  That call was a damn snowflake call.
6014901,Suck an egg you pathetic excuse for a cogent american.
6014908,Blacks are intellectual inferiors even to Mexicans!
6014943,"SA should not print yobo's mean-spirited, worthless comments."
6015000,"Hey Robert, why havent you ripped into the trash players for disrespecting the country that made them.  Robert Kraft is obviously just a piece of trash himself."
6015003,"Winning!  /s

LMAO...what a useless piece of garbage Trump is."
6015259,"But that's what you get now for minimum wage.  

Increasing that to a 'livable wage' for the exact same people is stupid!"
6015435,"‚ÄúThe vast majority of our officers are honest, hardworking and committed to public service. The few who are not must answer for their actions.‚Äù
Com'on Carey.  We not interested here in your first statement.  Public servants are paid by the public and expected to do exactly that, in the MINIMUM.  Yeah, yean.  Policemen get our ""thank you for your service"" and ""you one hero"", but what we're really interested in having you elaborate is not about the first statement.  We like you tell us ALL about the second statement.  The stupid, crooked, corrupt, or lazy cop is like the cockroach in the stew.....one is one too many.  Tell us public what we really need to know."
6015548,"AFD isn't Nazi you dips*it
They are normal moderate conservative people who are trying to save their country and culture from annihilation

Grow up with your fake news crap
typical G&M fake liberal poster"
6015564,"Listen you knuckle heads, this has got nothing to do with race. its about our fallen and maimed soldiers. Have some respect"
6015607,Its a good thing the Broncos were so focus that the Won....... Oh wait they Lost? Well at east the steelers had their head on too.... What they lost too? Maybe if you guys would focus on the damn game I wouldn't be so pissed off that you guy sucked today.
6015681,She suffers from Trump derangement syndrome.
6015719,Good riddance and take your butt with you.
6015751,This country has been disrespected by all of the fools arguing with each other about standing or not standing for the anthem at sporting events that purely serve to entertain the ignorant masses. And it was all started by our President. Greatest country in the world? More like stupidest country in the world.
6016065,"Yeah, I do know you, you're disgusting and shameless and your misapprehensions aren't founded in any actual American tenets or ideals.

You're a fraud.
Nothing more than an unthinking hypocritical troll.

(and I already told you that it's Trump who disrespects that sacrifice you throw around as if you understood it, which it's clear you don't.)"
6016105,I wish this Maverick mother f**cker would shut the f*** up and go away and take Hillary and Hussein with him
6016136,"""Fly the flag of the army of northern Virginia proudly!""

The only flag of the Army of Northern Virginia that matters is the white one Lee dragged with his when that Traitor-in-Chief surrendered to General of the US Army Ulysses S. Grant."
6016142,Idiot isn't a hate word. And you're an idiot. Flag away coward.
6016155,"Brilliant retort... It only makes sense that in order to weigh in on government and its decisions, you need to be also running for office during a non-existent election. Oh wait, only an idiot would think that."

6016259,Burn it.
6016478,Eff the anti-American Donkeys.
6016735,"Pope is the anti-christ.  Roman Catholics welcome all of you to ""Team Satan.""  The devil and his demons said keep feeding me your  children. ""Feed me more.""  The devil and his demons are the angels of light who masquerades as the servant of righteousness.  RC flock are either very, very, stupid or very, very, smart.  Just like a dog who keeps returning to his own vomit and a washed pig that returns to the mud, they never learn."
6016736,"What's really disgusting are so-called ""Americans"" who support people from other countries coming here illegally, breaking our laws, using our resources, thumbing their noses at those who did it the right way, and being rewarded by cowardly, stupid politicians.  I submit to you that these vile people are anti-American."
6016896,You got this backwards.. idiot criminal supporters started it..
6016931,That's more than bigots deserve
6017041,What the hell is wrong with you?  Have you been lobotomized?  Your comments are totally ridiculous. Go back to whatever hole you came out of and let the adults have a conversation here.
6017046,Idiot.
6017082,But aren't you all getting really tired of the gay in your face propaganda day after day. Why can't they simply go to a different gay friendly bakery?  Instead they continue to try and force their lifestyle down all of our throats and destroy good people in the process. I for one am sick of it all. Time for a straight pride parade!
6017208,"Let us stick to the subject of Trump not respecting many humans, one second they are his ""best"" pals  ( I have so many wonderful friends he says non-stop) and the next second Trump has made up a silly name for them and puts it on twitter since he appears to have a lot of time for nonsense. So what is the deal that Puerto Rico is in crisis and Trump is taking on the entire NFL. No doubt this subject is more important to him then suffering and dying  American citizens. But I will give Trump the benefit of the doubt, maybe his aides forgot to tell him Puerto Rico belongs to the US and not Cuba."
6017345,Unfortunately we become more and more desensitized to this baboon's idiotic nonsense. Good on the sports heroes for openly rejecting his stupidity. They have a platform from which to do so.......
6017411,"Mr. Trump didn't do that? Kaepernick did it (first), other players followed. Our president has no fault here. 
Obama is responsible for our divided country. Massive success in setting race relations back at least 50, maybe 75 years or more. Pretty soon, blacks will be demanding their own separate water fountains. 
All part of the much bigger plan to disrupt and eventually destroy American freedom.
Plus, Kizla is an idiot and could only work for The Denver Pravda!"
6017469,"That's what happened when all the 'politically correct' people elected a muslim, who in himself, hated OUR country.  Notice most of the protesters are black.  If you don't like this country, move to North Korea....you should have one hell of a life there."
6017482,"Fans Boo'd those idiots. Rating plummet. Boycott the sissy sport. Throwing flags for not helping players up. ppl who kids have dies for that flag have to watch this, NOPE! This has Zero to do with Trump."
6017581,Keep giving publicity to this and it will never go away.  Let's put every rude and stupid person who does something silly in the crowd on the jumbotron and give them a  write up in the next day's paper and then complain about what they did and wonder why they keep doing stupid stuff in the stands.
6017734,Exactly the opposite. They just post the same garbage. And they were caught many time posting false info.
6018067,Trump is another example of how no amount of money can prevent someone from being white trash.
6018293,"McCain is showing the true class that is bewildering to trump & his supporters.  He saved the GOP from itself, so far, by not supporting their latest stupidity on health care."
6018352,"It's not illegal for him to express his opinion on this matter - dumb, but not illegal"
6018400,Don't make me laugh... Brandon didn't do a damn thing except have a 10 minute meeting with the police chief over tea & crumpets. He's just as ignorant and stupid as the rest of the knee benders.
6018451,"""Unlike the 60 million American GOP voters, Germans are generally not stupid.""
Is that you Hillary?"
6018501,"The only disrespectful person I see here is the money-laundering, lying, commie-loving, mentally ill pig in the Whitehouse."
6018510,"I did, and I watched an idiotic play by MR DENVER GOD Von Miller that extended a drive for Buffalo and made it a two score game. At least he knelt for the social injustice that makes him millions a year and a 1%er, though."
6018623,"We would all be better off if the President was sane.  He's not, of course.   His sad sycophants think he's being tough, when in fact, Trump is being an imbecile.  LeBron James is right.  Trump is a bum."
6018698,I've never before seen so much ignorance in a single post. You have absolutely no clue what you're taking about. The sheer level of stupidity you managed to cram into just a few sentences is amazing. How can someone be so utterly wrong on so many levels.
6019069,"Trump may not have  immediate access to the nuclear codes, but his mouth is just as dangerous."
6019085,"The rude reality is the DPRK reasonably interpreted Trump's tweets when they arrived at the conclusion that the US has declared war.  If China agrees then they can be relied upon to defend NK if the US reacts to one of their bombers being shot down. 

Trump keeps on losing these subtle political fights and hasn't a clue.   He has no game and is proving himself to be dumber than pretty much everyone, everywhere.   This is ridiculous."
6019105,Kill it already and go back to the drawing board.  What is the GOP trying to. do again except re- redistribute wealth again between those with nothing and those with money to burn?
6019275,Oh the irony.   Mostly black millionaire professional athletes protesting on national tv for equality!  What a hoot.
6019331,Mccain is just a filthy dirtbag. The sooner he leaves us the better earth will be.
6019414,Sex in prison ought to be interesting for him
6019460,"For the most part, the BLM protests actually are peaceful, what ends up happening, is a handful of idiots show up and think the right way to protest is to destroy property.  The press decides that the burning is the story, completely ignoring the hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of peaceful protesters who are there."
6019694,"What a stupid question.  How about the taxpayers right to enjoy our facilities?  The state and city are more concerned with the non taxpaying vendors, how much you want to bet that they don't pay any taxes!"
6019737,And they died defending a persons right to protest. I spent over 22 years in the military. I find the phony patriotism exhibited by Trump to be hypocritical.
6019884,"Customers are part of the equation, doncha think? But you're right, when it was a handful of misguided athletes showing themselves to be idiots, I put up with it. Now that the owners have joined in, the NFL is dead to me."
6019977,Trump called neo-nazis peaceful protesters and NFL players son of a bitches that should be fired. Says all you need to know.
6020205,The stupid TV clown Trump has totally mishandled this. He has put the entire world at risk to salve his bloated ego.  He needs to step down for incompetency.
6020377,And... this is why things are so messed up in our country - everything is racist. Mr. Cho - you Sir are an idiot!
6020389,"No, Kaeps is still an idiot who cannot win ball games anymore."
6020411,"Finally the petulant McCain reveals his true motivation for his positions on health care. Time for that fool to retire. See ya, Maverick."
6020558,Troll.
6020575,"baloney. Obviously, either your memory is shot, or you are just lying. 

I was rooting for McCain right from the start until he picked up Palin. Actually, when he first picked her up, I was in favor until allen and a few others pointed out her record and how stupid she was. Even back then, I was saying that McCain would not last a year in the office and therefore Palin would be president. 

That is when I changed. 
And BTW, you backed McCain and declared him a hero. Now, you declare him an enemy of the state again, based on lies from the far right?"
6020653,Game on.  Kill that fat yobo before he hurts anybody.
6020911,"Trump is a failed imbecile and his administration is in shambles.  He has been able to successfully divert the attention of his sycophants to this new shiny ball, rather than have them notice the fact that everything he touches turns to dung.

How reassuring that we have a fool for a PM who thinks just because he signed a farcical treaty where China promised to curb their theft, it will actually stop.

Everyone looks down at this clown the same way the world saw Neville Chamberlain waving his signed treaty with Hitler promising a comical pact of non aggression and halt of annexation.

Canadians have enough to worry about his latest tax attack on small business. He expects business and and everyday Canadians to assume all the risk knowing the Liberals will always get the majority of any profits made?

""as Michael Tonry, professor of law at the University of Minnesota, told us back in February. ""Whites are more likely to sell to people they know, and they much more often sell behind closed doors. Blacks sell to people they don't know and in public, which makes them vastly easier to arrest.""

Blacks arrested for drugs are more likely to be sent to jail because they're more likely to have had a previous run-in with the law. Police tend to patrol high-crime areas more aggressively, which tend to be the poor areas, which have a higher proportion of minorities. Thus, they're more likely to be stopped for something and have a rap sheet once a drug charge comes along.""

@John Elway, I have been a die hard Broncos fan for over 40 years, welcomed you when you joined our team, respected you for being a stand-up guy and loyal American and now wonder what happened to you and the Broncos.

As it happens, those docs are in very high demand, generally have long waiting lists, and will be happy not to see patients who see a negative correlation between income and quality.

Conversely, there are great docs who have no outside income, so a patient who thought ""more income is better"" might make the mistake of avoiding an excellent doc.

<Criticizing it is Trump's right.>
Absolutely; Trump's rights under the Constitution are neither less nor greater than anyone else's. I suppose he has the right, too, to call the protester a ""son of a bitch.""* However, in doing so, Trump demonstrates his ignorance of and contempt for the Constitution -- as well as his disrespect for the people of the United States.

Vaughn's attempts to ground current German attitudes and behavior in Prussia and the Soviet occupation is like me trying to say that Canadians love to travel because of Canada's experience in the fur trade; or saying that Canadians are anti-American because of the war of 1812. Just plain stupid.

I can think of one thing that the government should be addressing. Why is motor fuel selling for the same amount as when oil was over a hundred?

It's Florida and Texas. They vote for president. Contrast this to Puerto Rico where the strategy was to drop goods into distrubution centers  for the local government to distribute, with no forethought that there would be no way to distribute those goods without gasoline and adequate transportation.

That folks is either from a shameless pathological liar, or the dumbest political clown you will ever meet; either or, they're running our schools. 
 The feather is evil, it is racist stereotyping, but a horse is sacred and holy [sic.]

I recall those perpetrators being released and having a parade in the Puerto Rican neighborhood of NYC.  I recall them being hailed as heroes when they returned to P.R.  I also remember well that there have been three elections in Puerto Rico.   The people had a choice of becoming a state (This would have required them to pay federal taxes.  They never paid a cent.) or to vote Independence or to leave things as they are (Get all the free stuff and benefits from the U.S. just as if the whole island was on federal welfare.).

The groundwater argument is wrong: gas drilling and fracking occur far deeper than any groundwater, and is contained in steel pipes to contain the fracking pressure and prevent gas (and fluid) escape. Once drilling and fracking is completed, the gas pads are quite unobtrusive, and much more widely spaced than conventional drilling - fracking is environmentally more benign than any other method.

The economic arguments are not my field, but you are attaching them to prognostications about the geology that are completely erroneous - there is no data on which you can base your tendentious and accusatory statements: - ""calling to account"" overstatement of ""reserves"" ffs as if you knew and that the scientists lied. 

Your methodology is similar to that of KPMG: find a brothel regardless of the facts.

Evidence has since surfaced that suggest the killer had sex with Shepard but experienced self-loathing for it due to societal pressure then cracked. Regarding the Orlando killer, it's possible that he was gay, but he was a Muslim who lived with a woman he called his wife, and law enforcement officials have stated that he scoped out the nightclub where he killed people weeks before gunning those people down, and even went on Grindr in order to try and understand the mindset of gay men before he proceeded with his heinous atrocity.

Trump is not normal or typical, thank god, of the character of our past 10 presidents (including those I strongly disagreed with).

Of course it's better to make the playoffs than not make the playoffs.  Of course it's better to have a hot streak than not have a hot streak.  But my point was that aside from that early hot streak, they were an average-at-best team for most of the season.  The early hot streak was the anomaly.

Although Trump described the Las Vegas shooter as a ""very sick, demented man,"" on February 28 he signed a bill that reversed an Obama's implementation of a bill (NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007) signed by President Bush in January 2008 in response to the Virginia Tech shooting. It required that the Social Security Administration report the names of roughly 75,000 mentally impaired recipients to the national background-check database.

Candidate Trump received $969,138 from the NRA and other gun ‚Äúrights‚Äù organizations, and, in return for their generosity, his action protected the right of sick, demented people to buy guns.

It's unclear how many of the 75,000 mentally impaired Social Security recipients are NRA members."

He's so bad at business that most of Wall Street would not loan him money.

This was a country music show in America. Country music - the stuff gun nuts all listen to, the stuff they blare when they walk into family restaurants with an AR-15 slung to their backs and say they are excercising their ""rights""*. There were probably more guns in the crowd than in Paddock's hotel room.

*I put rights in quotes because even in America you don't have a right to carry a gun onto somebody else's private property without their permission. Open-Carry laws don't actually mean the owner of the local McDonalds has to allow you to scare kids with your massive penis-extension hanging out. Indeed, any SANE restaurant owner would call the cops thinking he is about to be the victim of an armed robbery - and if a black man does it, you KNOW he will."

She is as corrupt as they come."

The shooting of black people by the police are incomparable to shootings of white people pm e by police. Forget black on black or white people, this is about oppression.

Hitler and Goering declared animal experimentation ""verboten"" in 1933, the latter threatening those ""who still think of animals as their inanimate property"" with concentration camp internment.  Folks, this is the TRUE face of the ""animal rights movement"".  Whales and dogs are sacrosanct, humans not so much.  Hitler and Goering certainly had no problem experimenting on humans--of certain ""types""--however much concern they declared for puppies, kitties and bunnies.  And one of the modern purveyors of this sickness is Princeton's Peter Singer, PhD, the so-called ""father of animal liberation.""  This idiot argues that a dog is of greater ""ethical worth"" than a two year-old human child, and that therefore killing a CHILD is less reprehensible than killing a DOG.  Just as Joseph Adami argues that starving native Alaskans--or rounding them up on ""reservations""--is preferable to killing whales."

And that, of course, led directly to Donald Trump, the self-styled authoritarian who claimed he can see to your every need by simply declaring that it's solved. Oh, and walls.

First of all there are numerous non-white role models in our society, like Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King, president Obama, or Malala Yousafzai. The fact that 12 year old children don't list these people has more to do with what they watch and read today. Don't forget ""Bollywood"" which is a bigger film industry then Hollywood and generates (non-white) role models for billions of people. 

Canada has provided non-white people opportunities which they would not always have had in their home countries. Canada is a great country because we welcome these people and allow them to pursue their dreams. However, we should not start creating divide between white and non-white people."

Simple.

Where is 'Merry Christmas' no longer allowed in this country? Where? Name one place -- one state, one municipality, one jurisdiction -- where people are prohibited from saying 'Merry Christmas.' Just one will do. 

I don't oppose Trump because he's conservative. In fact, if he were consistently conservative I might be able to muster some support for him. I oppose him because instead of doing things that matter he's content to pander to those who already agree with him. That's not leadership. It's cowardice and narcissism.

And let me be clear these were all democrat women you turned your back on.

We have a pathological liar in the White House, unfit intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically to hold this office, and the whole world knows it, especially those around him every day. The people who work with this president should be ashamed, because they know better than anyone just how unfit he is, and yet they choose to do nothing about it. This is their shame most of all.‚Äù

In fact, he was playing golf when the body o one of the soldiers was being taken off the plane.

We've heard it all before in the cases of Trayvon Martin, who was just trying a bash somebody's skull in, and ""Gentle Giant"" Mikey, who was trying to surrender with his hands up, pleading for the cop not to shoot. In both cases, black witnesses flat out lied about what they saw and heard. Were the liars ever prosecuted for filing a false report or for perjury in court? Nope.

And why is United's website so sucky? Why don't they hire Amazon to set one up for them? As you book a flight, they offer you deals on economy plus but you can't compare the deal with adding the seats separately. Different times it adds up different ways. You might have to go through the entire booking process several times. And have you ever tried to cancel one flight on a combined ticket? Forget it. Everything is difficult.

McCain can't win any rational argument with Trump. Regardless of how low Trump's character is or was, McCain won't  win this battle of decency .

My little guy has had a rough life - he lost one eye 5 years ago and had all his teeth extracted on Friday before I adopted him on Monday a little over a year ago.  Nonetheless, he is the sweetest, most trusting guy in the world.  I would totally support a ban on declawing.

If you want to talk politics like a child, go to the Sesame Street forum.

Second, I am not a fan of Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton got deferments just like Trump did except that Bill Clinton was eligible for the draft.

So by your logic, Trump is much worse than Clinton.

Thanks to mixed-feminist/Islamic messages from Trudeau, Muslim women need help in Canada - clearly, they're prisoners in a culture with misogynistic cells, where many masochistically self-impose a lockdown with religious fervour and stubbornly argue with critics that it's their democratic right to do so.

Easy to speak for the few, too bad it imprisons the majority of fearful moderate Muslim women who given the chance just want to blend in with other western women.

How do we know this? Just look at the historical direction of Muslim women in Iran, Pakistan, Turkey and others where gradual relaxations on strict cultural garb inevitably leads to crushing crackdowns upon women by male Islamic religion police - be they official or unofficial."

He totally failed on that. Huge whiff. Then, all he had to do was to make a phone call to a widow about her fallen husband, and he struck out on that, too. Even after it comes out what happened on that call, a better man would have asked how he could rectify things. Instead, just more bullying from this jack***. A complete loser, and a very little man.

Senators have been appointed to do a job. In order to do this job, they have been given certain powers in full accordance with the constitution of Canada.

If you don't like the manner in which they exercise their powers, that's one thing - just part of the normal grumbling about politics that comes hand-in-hand with any issue. And if you don't like the powers they have, a very simple procedure is open to you: amend the constitution.

But to suggest that they should not exercise the powers with which they were entrusted due to some feeling that the constitution is a flawed document which should be ignored is simply contrary to the democratic process and is the first step to authoritarian rule."

If there IS pressure, he doesn't feel it and gets sacked &/or fumbles. But if there ISN'T pressure, he sees ghosts and panics ANYWAY. And he COMPLETELY stares down his primary receiver.
And THEN, he throws a crucial 2 point conversion WAY out the back of the end zone, when it would've been better to throw it DIRECTLY to a Chief, like he did numerous OTHER times during the game, & at least they might've accidentally TIP it to a Bronco. When he AIR MAILED it 10 feet over his head, DT had NO chance. 
And Joseph? We heard that he was such a red hot coaching commodity, but the FIRST time I heard him try to speak, my heart dropped. And AGAIN, he said that we CAN'T make a QB change if it's a 2 possession game. WTF?! So if a QB throws 6 picks but the D balls out, we can't bench the QB?!

I wish there wasn't racism in Canada but she has added to it with her bigotry and divisiveness.  One good thing about the Halifax incident is that bookers of shows and festivals can now decide if Pimienta's talent outweighs her unpleasantness and potential for creating conflict.  (Ironically, she wants to tour Europe, the source of horrible white people.)  I happen to be white but know so many brown people as cousins, friends and fine co-workers that I think I know why there hasn't been an outpouring of denunciations of Pimienta's back-of-the-bus-ism from people ""of colour"".

No. However the psychological effects of having someone murdered in a community of 50 and a city of millions are worlds apart. 

These people are scared. There is no safety, there is no security, there is no government to help, there is no police, no big brother to help in their plight, there is nothing. You know what happens when people are scared they try to find something, anything to hold on to.

Yes some idiots tried to foster support for their old misguided delusional pre-94 days, and most of the people protesting are not super hard core freedom fighters. They just want to be able to make a living and have a future in the country they call home.

6266617,"And if Randall's point about the PFD is not adequate for you then how about the income tax this idiot demands we all pay because we are broke? 

Randall is 100% spot on here. This planet has has literally thousands of people working on all 4 areas the governor wants looked into. If you want an answer to any one of them all you have to do is open a page and read for 5 minutes. George, hes pandering to you.

The number of women going in computer science in the US has slid for 37% to 12% in CS.  What is the number of Vets ?  its about  85% know for women now.  The number of girls going into STEM in Norway is supposed to be going down (don't have a ref) ?  I don't know what the answer is but the old knee jerk answers don't seem to be holding up.

6267699,"How many times have you seen the following:  One transport pulling out to pass another and taking the next 10 minutes and miles of highway to finally get past.   All this and 1/2 hour later the truck which passed is 15 - 30 seconds ahead of the slower truck.    It's just not worth it.

Trucks should be in a restricted lane, and passing should be prohibited, except in designated areas.

Concurrent with this should be driver education about lane discipline and yielding (instead of blocking) when a car comes up from behind.    It is not up to drivers to enforce the speed limit.    So if a car is tailgating - just move over and let him/her pass.    Don't be a stubborn jerk and block traffic, which should be ticketable offence.     That will help traffic flow, and if the tailgater is really speeding (or weaving in and out) leave it up to the police to catch them."
6267829,"Folks. Don't think for a minute that facts and evidence matter here. Trump plays pure power politics. His boot lickers are going to believe anything he says.

6268607,"Right after Trump blamed Schumer, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Donald Trump had not personally blamed Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) for the terrorist attack Tuesday in New York City.

6269485,"Understatement of the year.  The Browns should be thankful that they are too stupid to file in time to make a deadline.  They were offering a 2 and 3 for McCarron.  Apparently they forgot that they are 0-8 for the year and have no hope, so trading for McCarron for this year made no sense.  They are going to be in position to grab one of the top QBs in the draft instead.  They can get a QB in the first then use that 2 and 3 for weapons, protection or defense."

6270062,"Might help if you read and comprehend rather than look for a tiny bit to argue.  READ again and you will see that our conversation is not about the car theft in itself.  ""The luxuries you mention"", does that ring a bell?  ""Not all of them of course"", ring a bell? Read again Mr. CannotComprehendCory.  Racoon and I never mentioned a car theft.  Of course cars have been stolen and of course that is something you want to argue, for what? Right! Ridiculous for you to jump in and reply in this manner, Duh!"

NO! We are fed up, Heated tents for foreign illegal immigrants, nothing for our own homeless. These people in the Liberal Party HATE US ALL who were born here.

6271707,"Zuma should never have gone past GO when he confessed to having sex with an HIV positive woman(never mind the rape accusations) without a condom knowing her status, and then having a shower to ward off the virus. His intellect and mentality at that point was obviously well below any acceptable standard. Anywhere else on the planet, he would have been banished to the compound of Nkandla, without firepool, chicken run etc but no, the ANC showed what they are all about and subjected us to years of humiliation and duncehood. It all points to the entire mob burying their noses in the trough like the pigs they are."

6271779,"No. You made it about race when you chose to act like some 0.3% of murders are different from the other 99.6%, more worthy of protest, and there was absolutely nothing else different about those 0.3%.
Only seriously extreme racists ever use the term 'race card'. Complaining about the race card is proof of being a racist. Non racists don't have any fear of discussing the influence of race on any topic.
And only the really dumbest of the dumb use the word 'libtard'.  Note how I discussed the issue in terms of numbers, facts, empirical reality untimely by emotion or group loyalty. I didn't 'bring race into it', I mathematically proved it could be about nothing else.

And what could you offer in return? Any rational thoughts? Improved numbers? A flaw in my calculation? Nope. All you have is a silly attempt at a personal insult. So I've won this debate by all measures. Just hush now. You're embarrassing yourself."
6271831,"I have not been a supporter of this movement, largely because I got tired of seeing endless ""whataboutery"" posts in totally unconnected threads that spouted patently false stats.

However, Grootes got up my nose hugely whilst I was listening to his show on the morning of this protest.

His desperation to get people phoning in who were observing the protest to tell him that the protesters were all white and that there were old SA flags all over the place was sickening.

His mealy-mouthed attempts to set the agenda on this tac were, quite frankly, disgusting, and that comes from someone who does not support any protest that sets out to infringe on the rights of others (blocking traffic is a massive no-no in my book).

The small minority who did insist on brining the old flag in whatever form are just idiots, and we know we have plenty of those from all walks of life in this country (Grootes having just joined that bunch with this latest pathetic attempt at appearing to be PC)."
6271862,"""How can any person, let alone the President of a country and leader of a once proud liberation movement place himself in such a sordid situation.""

6273422,"It isn't hate, it is simple facts:  liberals and democrats have endlessly attacked Western Christianity for the last four decades but suddenly want everyone to 'tolerate' and embrace Islam.  Very strange to hop into bed with a religion that executes homosexual and stones women to death for infidelity in 2017.  I wonder why?"
6273427,"When I watched the Broncos games past three weeks, their problem is not as simple as the inept QB plays.  The whole team looked a lack of discipline, solidarity and a strong leadership which can infuse each and every players to perform beyond their potentials and prowess. Stupid penalties and miscues here and there just proved that.   Remember the Mile High Salute Days and the charismatic coach Mike Shanahan?   When a good leader walk in to a room, his presence and influence can be prevalent inside the room and that bursting energy can inspire even the marginal players to perform superbly.  Instead of putting the QB under the microscope, the Broncos need to put the mirror in front of them and look at the whole team to find out what can they do convert these untrained sloppy recruits to the invincible Navy Seal Team."
6273590,What a scumbag. Cops should shoot him on sight with the slightest resistance. They should have done the same with James Holmes and the rest of the mass shooters and terrorists.

The 1st world trade bombing blamed Bin Laden, turns out to been false flag. USS Cole incident, not here, but blamed Bin Laden again, another false flag.  And we're not innocent. We take part. The 2 biggest terrorists in the world are Israel & America. Israel even committed 2 massacres in Qana, Lebanon, Jesus' family village, 1996 & 2004. Now they're blaming Christians. When they're done using US to kill Muslims, Christians will be next.
They're very brazen about it all. The Israeli artists left statues of gutless men in WTC as a message, ""Americans are gutless cowards who won't do jack."" Are they right? We covered up the Liberty incident, in the face of survivors who swore it was intentional. Israel's terrorism is very real and a huge threat to the whole world. They kill Americans so Muslims can be killed. And they call them terrorists! They're real Psychos"

You probably live on a road built and maintained by the government. You probably have trash and recycling pick up. My taxes contribute. I live on a county road that is privately maintained. We have to arrange for and pay for road maintenance, upgrades, snowplowing, trash. You should realize it does not affect you when parents get a tax credit. What you pay into the government goes into a big pool of money to be distributed and spent to benefit our society and you don't get a direct correlation of what you pay.  BTW -   I am older than you and have gladly paid taxes because our government should benefit us and provides the framework for businesses and our civil society.

Certainly those runs weren't all early and then abandoned. Passing didn't bring us back or even close for a last minute win, so what's the point, especially if poor passing/catching is digging the hole deeper. Not only were we passing from 30+ to 50 times (did McCoy mistake TS for PFM?), can you name a game last year or this year (excluding the 1st KC game in 2016 and we still lost that game!) where passing overcame being behind? Sorry, but it's widely known that a young QB's best weapon is a strong run game. We started 2017 with just that and our coaches saw fit to throw the following games onto Trevor's arm... I still say it was stupid!"

To say this sort of thing is un-presidential is a gross understatement, but more to the point it's offensive, and coming from Trump, it's actually dangerous.

No launch codes were ""hit"", though he did call for an end to the ""visa lottery"", which sounds like a great idea.

Yes, she has trampled on some politically correctness via religious shibboleths and that will cost her. But speaking the truth never comes without a price. 
My advice to those so aggreived is the same that I would heed myself in a similar situation: Listen to what is being said in its entirety and context, then next suck it up, buttercup."

You also continue to lie, for example about me 'name calling' when the only person I 'name called' is that idiot of a 'president' you seem determined to protect.

You might have some authority there."

Surely by this point, there must be an awful lot of Americans who have had it with mass shootings in the US and the inherent danger of just walking down the street or having dinner in some areas - now they're not even safe in church. And it's not because of those boogeyman Muslim terrorists, it's because of their fellow Americans with heavy weaponry and mean dispositions!"

Furthermore, to dispel you delusions, liberals are all over this board ripping on those they disagree with, who then melt like snowflakes when the favor is returned. it reminds me of the liberal hypocrites who go after my initials posted, claiming I am a coward hiding behind behind a computer screen, and yet have no problem with you going by fish.

We have seniors and veterans who have served and/or paid taxes for decades that need help being tossed into the garbage by this city council in the name illegal immigrants. Its pathetic and inexplicable that law abiding Coloradans are being ignored by HCock and his clown council to protect criminals... all while violent crime, especially murders, have gone up over the last 2 years on HCock's watch and nothing has been done to curb it. Denver will be South Side Chicago West in no time with this awful liberal leadership."
6309092,"This coward should have just used one bullet on himself and gotten it over with. 

Instead this scum targets children and babies, well he's not of a particular race or religion so Trump has given him a pass using the usual garbage of 'thoughts and prayers' and  saying this guy was mentally ill.

Mentally ill people do not murder children in cold blood,  evil, loser, inbred cowards do.  Trump won't even utter a single statement calling out this cowardly piece of trash, instead he deflect to Chicago?"

6310611,"Stupid, unhelpful, non sequitur post. Is that supposed to bolster the un-American position that people shouldn't have access to firearms? We can't hide and wait for armed police to show up. It could take hours or in some circumstances days for law enforcement to reach you here in Alaska. Freedom comes with risk that some will exploit it. We don't ban cars because some use them to run over people. Or alcohol because some insist on driving drunk. There're over 300 million guns in this country and somehow only about 13 thousand people are murdered with them each year. 15% more people are actually killed by drunk drivers each year in the US than are murdered with all types of firearms combined. So maybe we SHOULD talk about banning alcohol. If it saves even 1 life, right?"

Front of her own kids.  Guy down the street killed his wife and himself, probably because his 10 year old kid was out at 1 am egging peoples houses and his 17 year old kid was having parties every night and the guests would leave the party at 2 am and throw trash  bags of empty beer cans in everyone's yard.

The lady that exercised her First Amendment rights is not. You have no clue what the definition of narcissism is, nor do you have any clue what the definition of ""mental disorder"" is. So until you educate yourself, you will constantly look like a fool."

6324066,"Republicans are finally getting the point that the US is becoming less and less white by the day.  The timing of this action by Republicans - immediately after an anti-Trump thumping at the polls - suggests that they finally see the writing on the wall.

She was visited by an angel named Gabriel and brought the news to her that she will conceive The Messiah from our Heavenly Father. True Christians never compare their sins to the actions in the Bible. If these sexual activities are true, he must step down and face the consequences."

6326553,"Idiots. None of these numbnuts understand economics or smart enough to understand what Colorado and espcially Denver struggled with during the late 70's, the entire 80's, and first half of the 90's - an economically depressed state and city where jobs were scarce, layoffs frequent, and boarded up windows littering the state and Denver. If Amazon comes to the area, the exponential economic benefits will last a century. These clowns will be the same people who whine come next downturn‚Äã that they cannot find a job and the government is doing nothing to help."

6327287,I have to agree with local media here. Neither of those statements are racist whatsoever . But the fact he twisted it and played the racist card is pretty much expected. Minority‚Äôs have all the power . They can be racist by calling white peple racist and it‚Äôs okay. But muslims are the biggest racist around .  Just look around the world. Muslims are at war everywhere over race and religion. Everywhere. So for a Muslim to play the racist card. Would only work in Canada. Pathetic
6327302,"Nenshi is the same kind of  scumbag as Bob Rae and David Miller. More concerned with his personal agendas tnan with the real needs of actual constituents.

6327305,"I want more scientists and engineers in congress, and one of those types to president. They do what is right, logical, and will use reasoning instead of ideology to solve problems. They are just too smart to ever decide to do something so foolish."

Look.  You were hoisted on your own ignorant petard.  The proper response would be to slink away like the russian trolls, not to get mad at someone for responding to your specific argument."
6327569,"So, turns out the anti-gay bigot is a pervert and kiddie rapist.  Of course the GOP stands up for him.  Being a pervert is only bad if you're a democrat.  Its a bonus if you're a republican."

6328415,"There are many parts of Canada - rural and urban  -where drivers do not believe pedestrians and bicyclists belong on or near the road with them.

I have witnessed cars attempting to force bikes off the road  and have seen  cars, buses, garbage trucks and delivery fans exceed the speed limit at school crossings and on roads where pedestrians must share the curb.

The killings will continue as long as drivers remain ignorant of their obligations and responsibilities.

There are parts of the world where drivers drive efficiently and safely, where they stop for pedestrians crossing the road because it is the right thing to do and always always always slow down when or near pedestrians and bicyclists.

Travel to these countries and see for yourself: Germany, Sweden, Norway and Finland to name a few.

It is no coincidence these countries also rank highest on human and social development  and quality of education.

Stupidity is no excuse for driving badly. Smugness  is no excuse for bullying."
6328481,How dumb are these people? Do they not know that their entire religion is based on the belief that Joseph DID NOT HAVE SEX with Mary? He did not rub her. He did not place her hand on his underwear. Unbelievable hypocrites. Unbelievable.

6329522,why would you want to legislate stupidity?
6329639,Of course this web-fingered idiot defends Moore.  The state flag of Alabama is a pair of soiled underroos.  He fits right in down there.
6329724,You wouldn't know a troll if you looked in the mirror.
6329745,The modern GOP is simply proving liberal-progressives do not have a monopoly on stupidity. and with a little more effort they will achieve taking stupidity to an all time new level.

6329950,i wanted to know your reaction if he did that to your kid stupid DOOOn  SAAD Fuck you son bitch
6330160,"Actually, no. Religion is not intended to defend pedophiles, only lunatic pedophiles are the ones attempting to defend themselves."
6330290,"There is nothing wrong with defending an innocent man and political accusations are the worst form of ‚Äúevidence‚Äù.   
A true pedofile or molester cannot control their impulses and have the highest recidivism rates amongst all criminals.  According to all his ‚Äúaccusers‚Äù he stopped when asked and besides petting and kissing there was absolutely no sexual penetration nor forcible attempts made.  
I do not defend his actions as an adult 40 years ago but they were not the actions of the classic pedofile.  His marriage and fidelity are not the pattern of the deviant you describe. This is a typical political smear.    
I mock the lefts hypocrisy as they call their political opponents hypocrites."
6330424,Why would the right abandon Moore after these allegations?  The fact that that Moore wants to imprison gay people was fine with the right.  They are repulsive.
6330536,I suppose this jerk thinks they should throw rape victims in jail in Alabama. Every stereotype you have heard of Alabama is being confirmed by Roy Moore
6330585,"Hmmm.  Something doesn't compute:

1) The companies in Trump's (and Kushner's) portfolio are nearly all structured as pass throughs, helping Trump 'bigly'
2) The repeal (or diminishment) of the estate tax will obviously benefit Trump's family 'bigly'
3) The removal of the AMT will probably help Trump 'bigly' as well (Perhaps not.  Since Trump reneged on his pledge to release his tax returns, only Trump and his accountant would know) and;

4) Trump stated he'll be a ‚Äúbig loser‚Äù if the House Republican tax bill passes - Doh!


The only logical conclusion I see here is that Trump is a lying sack.  Shocker."
6330667,Hannity is such a sleaze bag that I dont care if people are unfair. He is supporting a lying racist president who is clearly a Russian stooge. He deserves no respect or fair shake of the dice.
6331086,"The whiners are so pathetic.  Most of them do not even live in Denver.  Because they HATE city life.  Or so they proudly tell us.

I love the life in Denver and that is why I live there.  This is a good investment in a GREAT city!"

6331762,"Steve  --  take a breath!  Today your posts are nothing but ad hominems.

Now that you've grasped the fact that fluoridation has been defeated in Port Angeles yet again, I imagine you're feeling pretty upset with us local voters.  Still, that's no reason to short-change your trollmasters by posting a flock of silly playground insults.  

Come on, Steve, pull yourself together.  You haven't once played fake-scientist today, nor directed anyone to ""ilovemyteeth.com.""  Here's a challenge:  Try NOT using the words ""conspiracy,"" ""corruption,"" ""nonsense,"" and especially ""antifluoridationist,"" just for one day."
6331818,"LOL.  What's ridiculous is your attempting to justify juvenile name-calling of US presidents.  And your hypocrisy.  

Thanks for helping confirm it."
6331873,Stupid idea.
6331933,"Omg , the issue is that trudeau is clueless. I dont think anyone would be making this big a deal out of this if he wouldnt have said anything about making the taxes ""fair"" with all the new proposed tax changes. Everyone knows this stuff happens and it always will. If he would think before he opens his mouth perhaps people wouldnt think hes such a twit. When he goes on about fairness and then this comes out he looks silly. If he would have left everything the same and this came out, not quite the same reaction.

More jobs, more people, more money, faster improvements on other things which are created by more jobs, more people, and more money.  Increased housing values, more education people, higher paying jobs, better infrastructure, added flights, more public transit, and on and on.  It would all come - both before and after amazon. 

You mention Denver sucks up half the transportation budget - we‚Äôll guess what - denver metro is over half the population. 
Amazon coming here would be a great get for the vast majority in the Denver metro area as well as many others across the state. That fact means amazon coming here would be a great get for Colorado as a whole. 

If you don‚Äôt like growth you should probably move to Wyoming, Montana, the Dakotas, somewhere that your small minded, short sighted, afraid of change life won‚Äôt be impacted too much.
