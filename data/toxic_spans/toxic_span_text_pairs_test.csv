"I am startled by the assertion that 50% of the American voters are just plain stupid.  so, say we compare the alleged stupidity of the American voter with the alleged stupidity of the Canadian voter (you just ask anyone involved in a rant about the unfair and completely stupid victory of the Liberal party in the last Canadian federal election: how stupid are Canadian voters if you thought 'the other party' should have won) - how does Canada compare?  Then, would you be prepared to offer up some kind of 'voter stupidity' measure, whereby we evaluate voter stupidity on some kind of international scale in order to identify 'smart outcomes of an election' VS 'stupid outcomes caused by stupid voters'?  Such a measure might be useful to politicians hoping to win in spite of voter stupidity and it might encourage tactics encouraging the stupid voters to just never mind voting because their stupid voting just gets in the way of the smart outcome.

And why is United's website so sucky? Why don't they hire Amazon to set one up for them? As you book a flight, they offer you deals on economy plus but you can't compare the deal with adding the seats separately. Different times it adds up different ways. You might have to go through the entire booking process several times. And have you ever tried to cancel one flight on a combined ticket? Forget it. Everything is difficult.

"What I am hearing Annie...is the rep strategy is to pass very quickly some version of  ""repeal replace"" on the ACA but date it after the midterms....(and forget the ""replace"").

I cited some data from the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities .....that note to some degree the dependence of Medicare currently on the ACA....my understanding is that Ryan wants to deep six the whole deal i.e. No ACA, very limited MediCaid and MediCare replaced by vouchers....

Vouchers for Medicare are the equivalent of ""block grants"" for other human services delegated to individuals (block grants are generally delegated to the states). Block grants promise an improvement that they NEVER produce.

The truly naive (and stupid) buy into the rep/Ryan thought that these vouchers will be generous and you can purchase health care with them....

Anyone stupid enough to buy this argument probably deserves them

My hope is that this travesty will get a lot of immediate criticism and be the ""third rail"" for reps.","What I am hearing Annie...is the rep strategy is to pass very quickly some version of  ""repeal replace"" on the ACA but date it after the midterms....(and forget the ""replace"").

"What a foolish comment.  In BC, after 20 years of prosperity and building under WAC Bennett's Socreds, in 1972 the voters experimented with the socialist NDP.  That lasted 3 years.  After that experience, BC was Socred for another  16 years.  The NDP were then elected in 1991, and ruled to 2001.  That experience with the NDP so disenchanted the voters that the 2001 election reduced the NDP to 2 sitting members.  Two.  Not even party status in the house.

Since 2001 the Liberals have picked up where the Socreds left off and ruled BC to the present day.  Under the Liberal's tenure, BC is now the most prosperous economy in Canada.  We have work and we have success and security.   

The people of BC vote for Socred/Liberals because we understand clearly what is detrimental to our well-being.  The only threat to our security is the socialist NDP.","What a <CSD> comment.

On the other hand it's mildly entertaining the way it might be watching a zombie apocalypse versus a threshing machine or something. <CSD>."

What they found most disturbing was that Trump met him then told his people, ""I want that guy working for me.""

They also showed Trump in an interview stating that 'Its all about genes."" It was like interviewing someone from the Third Reich.

Your opinion that pre-orders aren't a viable traction indicator is, frankly, nonsense. We clearly articulate preorders as ""strong leads"" in our offering circular. They are-- anyone who's put cash down, refundable or not, is a much stronger lead than someone who merely signs up for a test drive. Yes, we still have to build a compelling product, and continue to communicate that product to our pre-order customers. While some will certainly fall off, to me it seems likely they will more than be made up for from folks who are unwilling to place a preorder on something that is not yet in production, which is a very common refrain we hear.

2) Nearly all cyclists also have vehicles, so they pay the same taxes as everyone else. Your proposal is stupidly punitive, singling out a group whose actions benefit our society and automobile drivers.

"So, since the wars are over, the cruise missile attack into Afghanistan which killed the leader of the Taliban last week must be a war crime .  It was specifically authorized by President Obama according to his press secretary.

What other justification is there for killing an Afghani leader in negotiations with the Pakistani government to cease hostilities while he is driving through Pakistan after receiving medical attention in Iraq if it is not during a 'war'?  

And the cruise missile attacks into Yemen to support the Saudis and the daily bombings in Iraq from Italy by our Air Force and from our aircraft carriers are also post-war atrocities.

"Good for  Leonard Hecker for reminding  people about the difference between legitimate Veterans' groups and those that are just rip-offs (think of those melodramatic TV fundraising ads.)  While I'm not in the VFW as is Hecker, even as a peacetime Cold War Vet I hate to see con artists rip off vets. Hecker's  concern with Trump is well founded, for while he preaches respect for vets his own history here is shady.

During the Viet Nam war, young men who were draftable faced tough choices.  Many went and ended up in that brutal war; others strongly opposed the war and refused to go.  I  respect and  honor both those decent American groups.  
But a third faction   ""patriotically"" supported that endless  war but found ways to keep their own precious selves safe by endless deferments and questionable  methods.

While I'm not in the VFW as is Hecker, even as a peacetime Cold War Vet I hate to see con artists rip off vets. Hecker's  concern with Trump is well founded, for while he preaches respect for vets his own history here is shady.

During the Viet Nam war, young men who were draftable faced tough choices.  Many went and ended up in that brutal war; others strongly opposed the war and refused to go.  I  respect and  honor both those decent American groups.

"From all the moronic comments here I gather none of you have any first hand experience with sarcopic mange. Truthfully I hadn't either, so let me fill you in on what you've been missing. First your beloved pet breaks out with silver dollar size intensely itching oozing sores as the tiny near invisible mites burrow into your friend's skin to lay their eggs. Their fur is soon gone from the crusty oozing sores as you watch new sores begin to appear all over your pet's skin. They're miserable from the intense itching. Untreated the animal will lose most of it's coat and become very susceptible to respiratory infections. Really funny stuff. Right? It's highly, highly contagious. Domestic rabbits differ from their wild cousins in that they are much more social and will huddle together, making the parasite's infection spread that much easier.

"The lower dam was apparently plugged by rafting up logs then submerging them by piling rock on them, to form a latticework plug, of sorts, so why not just dredge them out and let the river flow under the dam, then install a gate to store water for times of drought?

Once the lakes were drained the dams could collapse in an earthquake with no real harm done, but would likely stand if a seismic sensor automatically opened the drains if things started rocking.

"And do you define ""solid proof'? Outside of mathematics and physics (correct me if there are others) you can never have definitive 'proof' of anything.

You can have evidence and in this case there seems to be many converging threads of evidence. The question is, why is all this evidence appearing in the political discourse now? Some people think that it's because Obama's a sore loser, or the intelligence communities want to embarass Trump, or they are simply inept. 

My theory is simpler. There is evidence because the attempt to influence the election was real and the dividends the Russians will accrue as a result are considerable.

Whipping was a common punishment at the time.  Freemen as well as slaves were frequently whipped.  Andrew Johnson was frequently whipped as a young man for his misdeeds.

When the Army of Northern Virginia invaded PA, they did not rape, steal, vandalize, and murder civilians as the Yank armies did throughout the South.  Their civility was due to Southern commanders like General Lee.
