"The Republican women senators you mention stood up because their constituents raised holy hell.

Her defense of Sessions made it impossible for me to have anything but simple human respect for her. She's not ""honorable"" because defense of racists is not honorable but unseemly, undemocratic and grotesque. I'd be interested to know what part of Trumpian policy you agree with. I'm sure the Republican agenda, which is primarily racist, will make great headway in 3 years. Trump has already normalized racism in front of thousands of boy scouts. All the world is observing Americans and how they are normalizing racism, violent sexism and homophobia.

"Siemian's HORRIBLE. And it's not just the ridiculous interceptions. He's terrible in literally EVERY facet of the game. Even when the pocket's clean, his throws are rarely on target. If there IS pressure, he doesn't feel it and gets sacked &/or fumbles. But if there ISN'T pressure, he sees ghosts and panics ANYWAY. And he COMPLETELY stares down his primary receiver.
And THEN, he throws a crucial 2 point conversion WAY out the back of the end zone, when it would've been better to throw it DIRECTLY to a Chief, like he did numerous OTHER times during the game, & at least they might've accidentally TIP it to a Bronco. When he AIR MAILED it 10 feet over his head, DT had NO chance. 
And Joseph? We heard that he was such a red hot coaching commodity, but the FIRST time I heard him try to speak, my heart dropped. And AGAIN, he said that we CAN'T make a QB change if it's a 2 possession game. WTF?! So if a QB throws 6 picks but the D balls out, we can't bench the QB?!

By your statement,  "" If people didn't get lost or stranded, there would be no need for assistance"", BINGO, you just answered you own support of assistance.  If people were not STUPID, there would be no need for ASSISTANCE.  I believe people  sometimes do STUPID things , because they think, well, this is risky, but there is  search and rescue.

"No, Trump, jr isn't a traitor, just a greedy opportunistic fool.
But there are too many people involved in the Trump campaign who have a serious medical or psychological malady where, the instant they're through talking to an influential Russian, they forget all about it.

Russia doesn't HAVE a crown prosecutor's office. If anything, it has a federal prosecutor's office. Russia -- in theory -- is a republic. The last ruler of Russia to have a crown prosecutor was brutally murdered along with his family, and then made a saint 80 or so years later.

It would be very sad if pets were killed, but ultimately it is the owner's responsibility to make sure their pets are not out killing birds.

Years ago some Vermont acquaintances got one warning from the Ranger: Next time I see your dog running deer, I'll shoot it. Next time she saw it running deer, she did. 

Vermont does not pretend that trapping, neutering, and releasing dogs solves any problems. They are serious about threats. We just want to feel good about ourselves. If we were serious about feral cats, we would kill them. Neutered cats eat birds. Don't release them. <CSD>."

"What I've written, out of respect for several people on this site, is nothing like the real antipathy I feel for Trump.    There are many people of equal or greater wealth than Mr. Trump.  Mr. Trump's vanity is absurd when looking at people like Gates, Buffet, Hemingway, or the accomplishment of women who have overcome bias to excel in education, the arts, motherhood and industry.   I'll celebrate the 95 year old matriarch still guiding her grandchildren to a good life, thank you.    How about the pastor or counselor who faces great emotional pain every single day and does so in private?   

Trump expects worship, he'll get none from me.

It's my opinion.  I don't like the man and it has little to do with his wealth.   I've met braggers and bullies my whole life, as you the reader have.   The fact that Trump wears a thousand dollar suit doesn't hide his sociopathic behavior.

"American voters opted to loath Bill Clinton's womanizing, but as far as we know he didn't rape any of his participants.

And let's not forget former House speaker, Dennis Hastert who repeatedly raped a teenage boy and wound up funneling $1 million + to the now adult male.  Hastert wasn't prosecuted for his past raping behavior.  This guy was two steps away from the White House for gawd sakes.
